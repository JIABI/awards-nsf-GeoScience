In these places, the collection of some other type of information can be remarkably useful in understanding flow patterns. This project investigates how fragments of biological material can be used in predicting river and stream flows. The biological material investigated in this project is the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of microbes found within water samples. This material can be collected and analyzed quickly, easily, and inexpensively. By using advanced biological techniques, the DNA found in streams can be translated into the relative abundance of different types of microbes. This project is based on the understanding that different environmental conditions, including flow patterns in rivers, cause different populations of microbes to become more or less abundant. This project supports an interdisciplinary group of faculty and students to develop new tools that relate stream and river microbes to hydrologic flow patterns. The project partners with a local organization focused on connecting under-represented communities with science professionals.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the collection and sequencing of streamwater DNA at a suite of long-term gauging stations spanning a range ecohydrologic conditions across the Pacific Northwest. Using 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing, the relative abundance of different microbial community members is quantified at each location, and patterns in community composition is related to river flows with machine learning techniques. These methods are then extended to regional and national level datasets of streamwater microbiome composition to determine the macroscale hydrologic information contained within streamwater DNA at different scales. For the duration of this project, a team consisting of high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students is engaged in advanced biological, hydrologic, and machine learning techniques to investigate connections between streamwater DNA and watershed function. Both hydrologic and microbial tools and techniques developed through this project will be disseminated to the wider community in a variety of forms, including traditional scholarly outlets and as open-source interactive electronic text for general education about hydrology. This project includes training in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) for students from high school to the PhD level.

It is therefore critically important to establish and enable transnational frameworks so that data-driven scientific knowledge can transcend disciplines and geographical borders, ultimately increasing the scientific underpinnings of policy and action. International collaboration within global environmental change research fields holds the potential to establish international foundations for federated data integration and analysis systems with shared services, bring together best practices from the public and private sectors, foster open data and open science stewardship among the science communities including related areas such as publishing, and encourage data and cloud providers and others to adopt common standards and practices for the benefit of all.<br/><br/>This award supports U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 29 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum Call for proposals on Science-driven e-Infrastructure Innovation (SEI) for the Enhancement of Transnational, Interdisciplinary and Transdisciplinary Data Use in Environmental Change.  SEI is a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that bring together environmental, social and economic scientists with data scientists, computational scientists, and e-infrastructure and cyber-infrastructure developers and providers to solve one or more of the methodological, technological and/or procedural challenges currently facing inter-disciplinary and transdisciplinary environmental change research that involves working with large, diverse and multi-source transnational data. The SEI call will intimately link research thinking and technological innovation toward accelerating the full-path of discovery-driven data use and open science and enable a broader scientific community to benefit from the identified new and potentially disruptive demonstrators or pilots toward solutions.<br/><br/>Scientific research is generating an increasing number of digital images, from micrographs of cells to pictures of galaxies. Automated instruments can capture many images, which are then processed automatically to extract data from them. For this data to be useful to the scientific community and benefit the general public, it needs quickly generate output (even for millions of images), consistent, and easy to share. Digital imaging can help determine how many organisms are present in a given environment, how diverse the organisms are and whether these data change in time.  This technique is particularly useful underwater, where direct observation by humans is difficult. The main goal of this project is to build a World Wide Web of Plankton Image Curation applications that collect images of plankton (the organisms that drift with ocean currents), allow scientists to name them consistently, store associated ecological information (such as time, location, etc.), and make all data easily accessible to the community. It will leverage cutting edge advances in database design and machine learning to process billions of images, will be hosted on public web servers to be easily accessible, and will foster an atmosphere of collaboration and sharing that is essential for the progress of science. This network of applications will be used to tackle studies that have proved challenging, such as fast plankton monitoring to assess ecosystem health, or global estimations of the distribution of planktonic diversity and its contribution to carbon storage or ecosystem productivity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, shear-driven mixing events near the ocean surface flux heat and CO2 into the ocean interior. Previous studies of shear-driven mixing events have assumed that the event is isolated in space and time, i.e. it begins with smooth, laminar flow and is located far from any boundary or other significant flow structure that could impact its evolution. This research will address the effects of spatially proximate influences such as the ocean surface, the bottom, or another nearby mixing event. The main tool will be a sequence of direct numerical simulations of sheared flows with either a boundary or another flow structure close enough to influence the mixing. Results will be used to guide parameterization of turbulent fluxes near the ocean surface and in deep ocean currents such as dense overflows. The results will be useful in understanding dense bottom currents, surface mixed layers and in parameterizing the resulting turbulence. The project will support a postdoc and a graduate student. Both of these junior scientists will learn and use advanced numerical simulation skills. In addition, both will have the opportunity to take part in research cruises to observe shear-driven turbulence.<br/><br/><br/>The Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) ansatz is a common and useful model for ocean turbulence. It is often used to describe turbulence near boundaries, e.g., in near-bottom gravity currents or at the base of a surface mixed layer. While linear theory tells us that boundary proximity can affect the basic length and time scales of KH billows, little is known of the effect on the nonlinear evolution and subsequent mixing. For example, KH billows with lengths up to 300m have been observed within 50m of the surface in the equatorial Pacific. In these cases, boundary proximity is likely to have a large effect on the resulting mixing and on air-sea property transports. In isolation, KH instability becomes turbulent via a well- explored sequence of secondary instabilities. This sequence is sensitive to the details of the initial shear flow, and it has a great influence on the amount of mixing that is ultimately achieved. It is hypothesized that a nearby boundary will alter the sequence of secondary instabilities and thereby change the amount of mixing. Even far from boundaries, e.g. in the thermocline, mixing events occur sporadically and may therefore feel the influence of other, nearby events. Using the petascale machines at UCAR,  a sequence of direct simulations will be made of KH events in the presence of boundaries and other flow features. Results will be used to interpret observations of shear-driven mixing events near the surface in the equatorial oceans and to broaden our understanding of the KH instability mechanism as it operates throughout the ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, prey often spend less time feeding and more time watching out for predators, which comes with the cost of lower food intake and thus slower growth. Such ""non-consumptive effects"" (NCEs) have been described for a wide range of terrestrial and marine prey species, from elk to clams, but mostly in short-term (< 1 month) experiments. These prior results suggest that in some cases, the behavioral changes (NCEs) have a bigger effect on prey populations than consumption by predators (CEs). However, those short-term, controlled experiments may artificially inflate the perceived importance of NCEs. Over longer time periods, prey may adapt or become acclimated to predation risk, and NCEs may become less important. Additionally, environmental variability (e.g., differences in the availability of the prey's food between study sites) may have a bigger effect on prey populations than NCEs do. This project will use a combination of short- (months) and long-term (years) field experiments and mathematical models to evaluate the role of NCEs on Florida oyster reefs. The prey species in this study is the eastern oyster, an important marine resource in the southeast US for harvesting and habitat creation; the main oyster predator is a mud crab. In this study, results from mathematical models of oyster populations will be compared to experimental data from the field to see whether including NCEs in the model leads to better model predictions. Better understanding of NCEs in oysters should improve management of that important marine resource. Furthermore, the mathematical model will be used to develop broader, generalizable conclusions about the importance of NCEs that could be applied to other important prey species. This project will provide data useful for oyster resource management, will support public education regarding the ecological importance of NCEs, and will enhance the scientific engagement of underrepresented groups in the study region. The project will support a partnership with the Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve in Florida, including data sharing, sponsoring an oyster management symposium, and funding the development of multimedia scientific outreach materials at the reserve that will be used by a large and diverse population of K-12 students in the surrounding community. The project will train a postdoctoral researcher, two graduate students, two undergraduate students, and research results will be disseminated by those students and the principal investigators at scientific conferences, in journal publications, and in online content through an ongoing partnership with a Florida public television station. <br/><br/>Predators can alter prey population dynamics by causing fear-based shifts in prey traits (nonconsumptive effect, NCE). The importance of NCEs for prey populations - relative to direct consumption by predators (consumptive effects, CEs) - remains uncertain, particularly because short-term studies of NCEs cannot estimate their effect over multiple prey generations. This project addresses that knowledge gap by combining short- and long-term field experiments with population models to investigate the importance of NCEs on oyster population dynamics in a Florida estuary. The central question is whether accounting for NCEs improves the ability to predict long-term trends in oyster population abundance. Several types of NCEs are present in this system: exposure to water containing predator odors reduces oyster larval recruitment and causes juvenile oysters to increase shell thickness, reducing their somatic growth. In addition to CEs and NCEs , environmental gradients in stress, food, and propagule delivery are also present in this system. Those environmental factors can have strong effects on post-settlement survivorship, growth, and recruitment of oysters, so the relative importance of predator CEs and NCEs may vary along those spatial gradients as well. This project will consist of four components. (1) A series of short-term field experiments to test how NCEs vary with predator density and environmental variables, and whether one of the NCEs (increased shell thickness) actually reduces vulnerability to predators. (2) A population model, parameterized using experimental results; model simulations will quantify how the relative importance of NCEs should vary over time, space, and environmental gradients. (3) A longer-term (3.5 year) field experiment; the results from this experiment will be compared to model predictions to test whether accounting for NCEs improves predictions of long-term variation in oyster population dynamics. (4) A general form of the model will be developed to broadly investigate the effect of NCEs on non-equilibrium, transient population dynamics. By combining models and field experiments, this project will bridge the gap between the theoretical understanding of how NCEs affect population dynamics and empirical tests of that theory, advancing the field towards the goal of predicting how multiple interacting factors structure communities."

The investment in this equipment enhances the analytical capabilities of a stable isotope facility that is used by a large community of US scientists and will facilitate a broad range of experiments for decades. Isotopes of carbon in fossil shells are useful as a chemical fingerprint of how carbon moves between various forms such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, dissolved carbon in the ocean, and as carbon incorporated into organic materials formed by plants and animals. Isotopes of oxygen are typically used to trace changes in physical environments, such as past temperature changes, and movement of water through evaporation, rain, or snow, growth or melting of glaciers, and freshwater flows into the ocean. This is important for fundamental understanding of the natural interactions between climate and life on earth, and provides scientific background for policy interests of the United States related to changes in natural environments. The equipment supports education and training of students, including experiential learning in STEM fields. <br/><br/>The Kiel-IV high-vacuum acid-digestion device acquired through this project is enabling new research directions and improves the analytical capabilities of the Oregon State University/College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences Stable Isotope Laboratory for measuring oxygen and carbon isotopes in ultra-small samples of carbonate (such as fossil foraminifera and other biogenic carbonates). The instrument is attached as an inlet system to an existing ThermoFisher 253Plus isotope-ratio mass spectrometer. This new equipment serves a large community of NSF-funded investigators, so will facilitate many projects. Primary applications are in paleoclimatology and paleoceanography. The equipment is also used in STEM experiential learning for students at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

These fundamental processes depend on the transport of babies (larvae) by the ocean currents, yet because the larvae are microscopic and diluted in the vastness of the ocean, it is very difficult to determine where and how they drift.  This project uses an autonomous underwater vehicle to collect larvae from precise regions of the water column.  Larval traps on the bottom and chemical analyses of larval shells will also be used to determine the depths where larvae swim.  These findings will provide realistic estimates for mathematical models that show how biology interacts with ocean currents to predict which methane seeps will be colonized by larvae originating at different depths.  A detailed knowledge of larval dispersal is needed for conservation and management of the deep sea. Without such information, we cannot know the best placement of marine protected areas, nor can we facilitate the reestablishment of communities impacted by deep-sea mining, drilling, or other human activities.  This project will provide hands-on at-sea training for college students to learn the rapidly vanishing skills needed for studies of larvae and embryos in their natural habitats.  Learning opportunities will also be available to individuals of all ages through new, interactive exhibits on deep-sea biology and larval ecology produced for small museums and aquaria on the coasts of Oregon, Washington and North Carolina.  <br/><br/>Reliable estimates of connectivity among metapopulations are increasingly important in marine conservation biology, ecology and phylogeography, yet biological parameters for biophysical models in the deep sea remain largely unavailable. The movements of deep-sea vent and seep larvae among islands of habitat suitable for chemosynthesis have been inferred from current patterns using numerical modeling, but virtually all such models have used untested assumptions about biological parameters that should have large impacts on the predictions. This project seeks to fill in the missing biological parameters while developing better models for predicting the dispersal patterns of methane seep animals living in the Gulf of Mexico and on the Western Atlantic Margin. Despite the existence of similar seeps at similar depths on two sides of the Florida peninsula, the Western Atlantic seeps support only a subset of the species found in the Gulf of Mexico. It is hypothesized that the ability of larvae to disperse through the relatively shallow waters of the Florida Straits depends on an interaction between the adult spawning depth and the dispersal depth of the larvae. Dispersal depth, in turn, will be influenced by larval flotation rates, swimming behaviors, feeding requirements, and ontogenetic migration patterns during the planktonic period.  The recently developed SyPRID sampler deployed on AUV Sentry will be used to collect larvae from precise depth strata in the water column, including layers very near the ocean floor. Larval traps deployed on the bottom at three depths in each region will be used in conjunction with the plankton collections to determine what proportion of larvae are demersal. Comparisons of stable oxygen isotopes between larval and juvenile mollusk shells will provide information on the temperatures (and therefore depths) that larvae develop, and geochemical analyses of larval and juvenile shells will determine whether larval cohorts mix among depth strata. Ocean circulation and particle transport modeling incorporating realistic biological parameters will be used to predict the movements of larvae around the Florida Peninsula for various spawning depths and seasons.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will test the hypothesis that Late Cretaceous extension resulted in the development of the Maniobra and Goler Basins, while simultaneously introducing more than 50 undergraduate and 2 Masters students to the techniques of basin analysis. The field sites in the Mojave Desert, located within 3 hours of Los Angeles, provide a natural laboratory to train the next generation of geoscientists. Students from a Hispanic-serving institution will learn modern geologic techniques, such as geologic mapping, geochronology, paleomagnetism, and thermochronology, that can be applied to their graduate and post-graduate careers. Analytical data from this research will be made available on community databases, and results of the proposed research will be used to construct a publicly-available online learning module.<br/><br/>Recent tectonic models of the southwestern US Cordillera have invoked the subduction of an oceanic plateau, the conjugate Shatsky Rise, as a driver of slab flattening, subduction erosion and arc cessation in Late Cretaceous to Eocene time. Subduction, and subsequent passage of the plateau, likely promoted extension and associated regional paleogeographic changes, such as basin development and block rotations. This study targets the Goler and Maniobra Formations, which are the only Late Cretaceous to Eocene basinal strata located along the interpreted subduction pathway. This research will test the hypothesis that gravitational collapse in the wake of plateau subduction was widespread across the Mojave region in the Late Cretaceous to early Cenozoic and led to the development of supra-detachment basins and the exhumation of relict subduction complexes. This research will incorporate new mapping of stratigraphic and structural relationships, combined with magnetostratigraphy, detrital zircon provenance analysis, and basement and detrital thermochronology. This data will constrain the timing and duration of basin formation and enable the evaluation of different tectonic models of basin development. New basin analysis results from the Late Cretaceous to Eocene Goler and Maniobra Formations will provide a crucial link between plateau subduction processes and related surface deformation and will highlight the complexity of tectonic evolution along a highly segmented margin over time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some VOCs that are produced in the ocean and then enter the atmosphere as gases have been seen to play an important role in climate. Since marine microbes both produce and consume these compounds they affect the concentration of VOCs in the surface ocean. The investigators found that as much as 20% of the carbon resulting from photosynthesis leaked out of microscopic plants in the form of VOCs. These molecules were then used by bacteria as a source of carbon and energy. This suggests that VOCs may play a more important role in the flow of carbon in the marine environment than previously thought. This project examines how microscopic plants and bacteria produce and consume different VOCs.  It supports professional development training workshops for Oregon high school teachers from rural areas in OSU?s Science & Math Investigative Learning Experiences (SMILE) program. SMILE?s mission is to close the achievement gap for underserved students by increasing their STEM-content knowledge, preparing them to succeed in higher education, and inspiring them to pursue STEM careers. This project also contributes to three workshops per year, training teachers and engaging students with hands-on learning activities on the topic of Carbon Cycling by Marine Microorganisms such as ?Clouds in a Bottle?. One graduate student, one post-doctoral scholar, and at least six undergraduate researchers are being trained by participating in research activities. <br/><br/>Field observations suggest that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by phytoplankton are either rapidly consumed by bacterioplankton in the surface ocean or emitted into the atmosphere. VOCs are an understudied path for carbon transfer in microbial food webs throughout sunlit marine ecosystems because these compounds require specialized detection methods. Using a new system to study VOCs in suspensions of live plankton cells, 20% of photosynthetic carbon fixation was seen to be transferred as VOCs from a diatom to SAR11 bacterioplankton in co-cultures. Many of these transferred VOC compounds were not known to be growth substrates for bacterioplankton. Both the magnitude and complexity of the observed VOC transfer were surprising. This project extends these observations to a larger set of phytoplankton and bacterioplankton through controlled studies of cultures, co-cultures, and mesocosms. VOC are detected via proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry and isotopic labeling is used to measure the impact of VOC exchange on rates of photosynthesis and bacterial production. VOC production by phytoplankton is measured in response to nutrient-driven variation in growth rates, and over day-night cycles to discern the relationship of VOC production to photosynthetic metabolism and other cellular processes. These experiments enable  a better understanding of field observations, in which bacterial consumption of VOCs can appear to significantly outpace production, while temporal variability in VOC production across daily to seasonal scales can cause VOCs to accumulate transiently to pM-nM concentrations in the surface ocean. This project contributes to close the significant gap in knowledge about the range and quantity of VOCs produced by phytoplankton, and about the roles played by these compounds in phytoplankton metabolism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current methods predict microbial rates in the environment using Monod equation and other models of laboratory cultures. But unlike cultures grown in synthetic media, natural microbes face the challenge of limited and fluctuating availability of nutrients, and thus have to regulate biochemical pathways and to fine-tune the rate and efficiency of metabolism. To bring metabolic pathways and regulations into the prediction of microbial rates, the investigator will develop a new modeling method that explicitly links microbial genomics to geochemistry. This modeling approach would allow to answer the question - how fast do microbial processes proceed in natural environments? The project offers learning opportunities to high school students and supports one Ph.D. and two undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The new method groups enzyme reactions within entire cells into two networks of catabolism and biosynthesis. It simulates the catabolic network using enzyme kinetics and biosynthesis network using flux balance analysis. The output of the simulation ranges from enzyme and metabolite concentrations at cellular level to microbial rates at organismal level. The investigator will apply the new method, coupled to biogeochemical reaction modeling, to simulate the metabolism of acetoclastic methanogens, a representative group of subsurface microbes, and to investigate the kinetics of methanogenesis in geological environments. The new method represents an important attempt to move beyond classical Monod equation-based models, toward an omics-enabled metabolism-based approach to the analysis and prediction of microbial processes in geological environments. Specifically, the new method predicts microbial kinetics and enzyme expression from genome and geochemistry of the environment, without the need of pure culture or laboratory experiment. This method therefore offers a new, and potentially powerful, method for studying microbial processes of geological environments, especially those cryptic processes that cannot be accurately analyzed in the field or faithfully reconstructed in the laboratory."

Santorini recently experienced geologic unrest and this study will document the current distribution of subsurface magma. Because the volcanic system is semi submerged Santorini is an ideal site for detailed imaging using marine instrumentation. Onshore-only studies cannot achieve broad enough aperture or dense enough coverag to allow mapping of magma throughout the crust. By determining the physical properties of the crust, this international team from the U.S., U.K., and Greece, seek to understand how magma at different depths crystallizes and what that might imply about both a basic research question- how does crust that eventually makes up continents form, and a geohazard question- does the current distribution of magma indicate a likelihood of sustained volcano inflation that might precede a major eruption? A US student will gain seismic data acquisition experience and training in state-of-the-art processing methods, while also learning to work within an international research team.<br/> <br/>Seismic imaging of the crust at Santorini volcano is designed to constrain the distribution of subseafloor magma and any variation in extent of apparent degree of crystallization with depth. This site is viewed as representative of silicic arc volcanoes worldwide, so results could be representative of other arc volcanoes. Ocean bottom seismometers, and land seismometers will be deployed for a few-week field experiment. Active source signals will be recorded by these instruments as well as by a towed, multi-channel streamer. Tracklines laid out along a north-east trending, 10 x 50 mile swath, with Santorini at the center, will be image the lower crustal structure with unprecedented resolution. Data analysis emphasizes complementary seismic approaches: (1) Dense 3D isotropic and anisotropic travel time tomography  (2) Full waveform inversion tomography and waveform modeling to obtain higher resolution and more accurate elastic properties and their spatial variability."

Decades of study on subduction zones have provided insight into the overarching processes that produce the magmas erupted, how the erupted magmas are produced at individual volcanoes, and a number of related questions. Despite this progress, a complex and largely unsolved problem is the cause of ubiquitous and dramatic variations in the amount and composition of magmas that erupt at volcanoes within the same subduction zone. Do these reflect processes acting deep within the Earth?s mantle, or in the overlying crust? Addressing this problem has important implications for understanding magma production and volcanic hazards, as worldwide almost a billion people live at risk from volcanoes. There is also a potential for scientific breakthrough by utilizing the existing large data sets acquired from recent NSF investments such as the MARGINS, GeoPRISMS, and EarthScope programs. However, addressing the question has proven challenging to date in part because of a lack of critical data for some locations, but largely because of the lack of suitable tools and approaches that allow us to quantitatively synthesize and compare the existing large data sets. <br/><br/>Thus, this is a multidisciplinary study to conduct a quantitative comparison of existing large geophysical and compositional datasets at the spatial scales of the entire Cascades subduction zone, linked through sets of common intensive variables such as heat and density, to determine the primary drivers of intra-arc magmatic diversity. Building on a successful Proof of Concept project that demonstrates the promise of the approach (Till et al., 2019), the project will test hypotheses about the relative roles of mantle magmatic flux vs. crustal characteristics and crustal magma storage depths in producing variations in erupted compositions and fluxes, and in controlling the geophysical state of the crust along strike in the Quaternary Cascades arc. The project has the potential to transform our understanding of these important regions and will produce a number of important broader impacts including, catalyzing interdisciplinary collaborations between three PI?s at three institutions, producing expert datasets widely and easily available to the Earth Science community, supporting undergraduate experiential learning activities.

These observations will be the first set of comprehensive, coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean energy and momentum flux measurements collected within a well-defined network. They will enable a process-based understanding of ice thermodynamics and dynamics via synergistic use of a coupled model. The Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition is a tremendous opportunity to leverage large US and international investments <br/><br/>MOSAiC is motivated by the changing Arctic system and declining sea ice, and their significant implications for the global climate system and numerous stakeholders. The initiative seeks to address leading deficiencies in model representation of coupled, atmosphere-ice-ocean processes in the Arctic system through intensive, year-round observations from a drifting station in the central Arctic and coordinated multi-scale modeling. This project will examine the detailed interplay of sea-ice thermodynamic and dynamic processes and how they control the state of the ice over a full year. This project will entail an observational array of five nodes installed at approximately 15 km separation in the central Arctic sea ice, each of which has systems to measure continuously the states of the upper ocean and lower atmosphere, the heat and momentum fluxes from the ocean and atmosphere to the ice, and the ice thermodynamic state and mass balance. A network of position buoys will be used to measure ice movement and deformation across the observing domain. Regional, coupled-system model simulations will provide the means to synthesize observational information towards process understanding. Together these tools will be used to build comprehensive sea ice energy, upper ocean heat, and sea-ice momentum budgets, examine how these co-vary in space and time over all seasons, and develop temporally-evolving process relationships among multiple key parameters. They will use the detailed observations and coupled regional model to examine how energy transfer processes (thermodynamics) are influenced by sea-ice deformation (dynamics) on sub-seasonal to seasonal time scales, and they will assess sea-ice predictability related to dynamic and thermodynamic process relationships, using a full year of quasi-operational, 10-day sea-ice forecasts. <br/><br/>Improved predictive models are an important means for addressing major societal needs related to Arctic change and declining sea ice. The project will provide an observational and process-based foundation for model development that has been called for by model developers and international experts. Moreover, it will offer insight into the sources of sea ice predictability, which will help to constrain future research pathways for improved sea ice models. The observations will enable a wide array of coupled system research that reaches well beyond the proposed project to impact research on other aspects of the Arctic physical, biological, and biogeochemical systems. Moreover, this project will support development towards autonomous ocean and atmospheric flux measurements that will help fill critical gaps in the Arctic observing network.

Circulations associated with frontal instabilities are capable of transporting material from the surface into the ocean interior and are likely a key element in the ocean general circulation. This research will yield quantitative estimates of these transport processes that can be used to improve parameterizations for ocean models used in climate studies. Participation by a graduate student for the duration of the project is planned and results will be published in recognized peer-reviewed journals. Elements of this investigation will be incorporated into Oregon State University graduate curriculum as well as in public learning efforts through a summer internship program involving high school students.<br/><br/>This research focuses on the properties and dynamics of coherent structures in the turbulent ocean boundary layer and on the conditions that support their development. This work will extend and complement previous studies that have examined or invoked Langmuir or symmetric instability processes to explain ocean boundary layer observations. It is hypothesized that the coherent, large-eddy structures observed in preliminary large-eddy simulation numerical experiments may be best understood as non-symmetric linear instabilities of a basic state that incorporates surface stress and buoyancy flux modification of a geostrophically balanced, horizontal density gradient. The first goal of this work will be specifically to address this hypothesis. The second, broader goal is, with the results of the first part as context, to use the large-eddy simulation to explore and characterize the dependence of ocean boundary layer turbulent processes, including especially the vertical fluxes and mixing associated with coherent structures, on the strength and character of mean horizontal gradients. A range of large-eddy simulations will be conducted to assess the relative influence of frontal gradients and surface forcing on coherent structure development and characteristics. Specific forcing parameters examined will include surface stress and buoyancy (heat) flux, surface waves (Langmuir circulation), and frontal (horizontal density or temperature gradient) strength, including where appropriate the derived Ekman buoyancy flux as a scaling parameter. The numerical simulations will be complemented by theoretical studies in the form of linear stability analysis for a generalized basic state that will provide a conceptual and quantitative framework for characterization of instabilities in the ocean boundary layer.  Specific objectives include: 1) Development of a generalized linear instability theory for comparison with large-eddy simulations and testing of the initial hypothesis; 2) Characterization of the dependence of turbulent structures and flux scaling regimes on the imposed surface fluxes and mean horizontal gradient, using large-eddy simulations; 3) Physical interpretation and rationalization of the large-eddy simulation regimes in terms of the results of the generalized linear instability theory."

The details of how smoke aerosol particles and stratocumulus clouds interact is inadequately understood, despite the disproportionally large role those types of clouds play in local and global climate. This project seeks to improve understanding of how smoke changes the way air circulates near clouds, how cloud droplets in polluted clouds evaporate at different rates from those in pristine clouds, and how drizzle is modified when smoke is present. Stable isotope ratios of oxygen and hydrogen in water vapor and cloud liquid will be measured from aircraft flights though smoke and cloud layers near Namibia to evaluate characteristics of atmospheric mixing, cloud evaporation and the fraction of clouds droplets which grow to produce rain. These characteristics are difficult to quantify from more traditional methods. Isotopic data will be used to evaluate entrainment and evaporation simulated by the NCAR Community Earth System Model to evaluate where new understanding from the experiment can improve model simulations. <br/><br/>Lack of knowledge about cloud-smoke interactions leads to crude treatment of processes in climate models, which consequently leads important unresolved uncertainties in climate model simulations. The isotopic study provides a sorely needed critical check on how clouds are depicted in models and gives specific guidance as to which mechanisms are incorrectly represented. The datasets collected enable several research groups to test and compare their models using isotopic constraints which will serve as a valuable legacy of the experiment. The data-model synthesis fosters collaboration that bridges between observation and modeling specialists and enables students training in combining expertise in modeling and data methods to achieve enhanced knowledge though synthesis.

Canyon-associated biological hotspots have persisted for thousands of years Along the Western Antarctic Peninsula, despite significant climate variability. Observations of currents over Palmer Deep canyon, a representative hotspot along the Western Antarctic Peninsula, indicate that surface phytoplankton blooms enter and exit the local hotspot on scales of ~1-2 days. This time of residence is in conflict with the prevailing idea that canyon associated hotspots are primarily maintained by phytoplankton that are locally grown in association with these features by the upwelling of deep waters rich with nutrients that fuel the phytoplankton growth. Instead, the implication is that horizontal ocean circulation is likely more important to maintaining these biological hotspots than local upwelling through its physical concentrating effects. This project seeks to better resolve the factors that create and maintain focused areas of biological activity at canyons along the Western Antarctic Peninsula and create local foraging areas for marine mammals and birds. The project focus is in the analysis of the ocean transport and concentration mechanisms that sustain these biological hotspots, connecting oceanography to phytoplankton and krill, up through the food web to one of the resident predators, penguins. In addition, the research will engage with teachers from school districts serving underrepresented and underserved students by integrating the instructors and their students completely with the science team. Students will conduct their own research with the same data over the same time as researchers on the project. Revealing the fundamental mechanisms that sustain these known hotspots will significantly advance our understanding of the observed connection between submarine canyons and persistent penguin population hotspots over ecological time, and provide a new model for how Antarctic hotspots function.<br/> <br/> <br/>To understand the physical mechanisms that support persistent hotspots along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), this project will integrate a modeling and field program that will target the processes responsible for transporting and concentrating phytoplankton and krill biomass to known penguin foraging locations. Within the Palmer Deep canyon, a representative hotspot, the team will deploy a High Frequency Radar (HFR) coastal surface current mapping network, uniquely equipped to identify the eddies and frontal regions that concentrate phytoplankton and krill. The field program, centered on surface features identified by the HFR, will include (i) a coordinated fleet of gliders to survey hydrography, chlorophyll fluorescence, optical backscatter, and active acoustics at the scale of the targeted convergent features; (ii) precise penguin tracking with GPS-linked satellite telemetry and time-depth recorders (TDRs); (iii) and weekly small boat surveys that adaptively target and track convergent features to measure phytoplankton, krill, and hydrography. A high resolution physical model will generalize our field measurements to other known hotspots along the WAP through simulation and determine which physical mechanisms lead to the maintenance of these hotspots. The project will also engage educators, students, and members of the general public in Antarctic research and data analysis with an education program that will advance teaching and learning as well as broadening participation of under-represented groups. This engagement includes professional development workshops, live connections to the public and classrooms, student research symposia, and program evaluation.

It has also been produced in a few laboratory experiments.  Such sulfate-bearing magma potentially carried much of the sulfur from deep sources in the Earth's mantle to the shallow crust.  Where arc volcanoes have erupted historically, sulfate-rich magmas have degassed abundant sulfur dioxide that enters the atmosphere and may produce up to 2 years of global climatic cooling with attendant human impact.  Where sulfate-rich magmas crystallize to granite in the shallow crust they may release water, up to one gigaton of sulfur, and metals that are responsible for formation of large mineral deposits of copper, molybdenum, gold, silver and other economic metals critical to the USA economy.  In order to understand better the contributions of calcium sulfate-bearing magmas to sulfur in the atmosphere and mineral deposits, the proposed research will undertake laboratory experiments on calcium sulfate in magmas, and document the occurrence of minute calcium sulfate inclusions preserved in natural magmatic samples.  <br/><br/>The first approach includes petrologic experiments on the stability of sulfate in oxidized and water-rich arc magmas that are planned at pressures ranging from the base of the crust (~1GPa) to the upper crust (~50MPa).  High pressure experiments on basaltic andesite will provide information on the transfer of sulfur in arc magmas through the crust, and the stability, nature and composition of calcium sulfate-rich melt phase.  Initial experiments have produced such an immiscible Ca-SO4-Na-Mg-Cl melt.  Analysis of both the silicate and sulfate melt phases will directly determine partition coefficient data for sulfur, chlorine and other species including ore metals such as gold.  Low pressure experiments on dacite will be saturated in aqueous fluid, and the concentrations of sulfur in all three phases (silicate melt, anhydrite, aqueous fluid) can be measured and partition coefficients can be determined. Direct measurement of the sulfur content of the one or two aqueous fluid phases will make us of laser ablation-ICP-MS on fluid inclusions trapped in situ in fractured quartz.  The second approach is to use modern imaging techniques (SEM, QEMSCAN, EMPA element mapping) to search arc volcanic and plutonic samples for minute inclusions of sulfate minerals in robust phenocryst minerals such as apatite, titanite, quartz, hornblende, pyroxene, and feldspar.  A special focus will be plutonic samples from porphyry copper deposits to learn whether or not these magmas were initially calcium sulfate-bearing.   The data from this work will allow improved and quantitative modeling magmatic cooling, crystallization and depressurization that causes the breakdown of magmatic sulfate and consequent transfer sulfur species (SO2, H2S) to a separate water-rich fluid phase that may either enter the atmosphere during volcanic eruptions or react in the crustal with metals in the aqueous fluid to form economic mineral deposits."

This is particularly true for the continental margin off Oregon and Washington State and Southern Canada, which is called the Cascadia Margin. This ~1000 kilometer-long subduction zone fault last ruptured in 1700 which produced a magnitude 9 earthquake that resulted in a large tsunami that impacted the Pacific Northwest and Japan and triggered significant underwater landslides. Gaining access to deep subduction zone fluids, however, is challenging because they are largely inaccessible, occurring at great depth below the seafloor. In 2015, a seep site was discovered off the Oregon coast where a jet of warm, hydrocarbon-enriched, low-salinity fluid was found venting from the seafloor. This site, called Pythia's Oasis, is unlike any seep site yet discovered, providing possible access to fluids formed deep within the Cascadia Subduction Zone. A second adjacent site includes an extensive collapse zone hosting multiple seeps that issue diffuse flows of warm and/or low salinity, methane-rich fluids that support dense microbial and macrofaunal communities. The goal of this research project is to better understand the heat flow around the sites in order to test hypotheses about the origin of these fluids and their effect on the environment. This will be done using a remotely operated vehicle from the National Deep Submergence Facility at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and heat-flow probes from the Oregon State University, U.S. Academic Heat Flow Capability system. If these fluids come from deep in the subduction zone, this site will provide an opportunity to study high-temperature fluid sources and reactions in the only segment of the Cascadia Subduction Zone that is inferred to be seismically active. Results of the work have implications for understanding deep-seated fluid and seismogenic processes acting in other subduction zones as well. Broader impacts include an at-sea student training program in which at least 10 undergraduate and graduate students will participate on the 13-day sea-going field expedition to the site where they will learn about and participate in seagoing activities and the discovery processes. The students will work alongside experienced scientists and ship and deep submergence vehicle crews to conducting their own research using data collected on the cruise and by later onshore analyses. Public outreach will be carried out via students who will communicate their experiences and findings through a cruise website and formal and informal presentations, with messaging focused on K-20 opportunities in integrated oceanography-engineering programs. <br/><br/>This research will involve collecting heat flow data in and around Pythia's Oasis, a submarine seep on the convergent Cascadia margin, thereby providing a process-based understanding for the thermal and hydrologic regime of the shallow Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ).  Pythia's Oasis is located ~80 km offshore Oregon and approximately 19 km landward of the deformation front.  This seafloor seep has been discharging an enormous flux of warm (11.8 degree C), low salinity (-0.6 PSU), hydrocarbon bearing fluid over a multi-year time scale.  Fluids being discharged there are hypothesized to result from high temperature (> 250 degree C) dehydration reactions that provide a view of deep-seated fluids.  The principal goals of this experiment are to: 1) measure heat flow in the region of Pythia's Oasis, on the incoming plate, across the deformation front, and the accretionary prism, using a violin-bow style marine heat flow probe; 2) link these observations with previously collected values of heat flow (seafloor probe, BSR estimates and continental measurements), along strike and across the forearc; and 3) develop models to better understand the thermal regime of Pythia's Oasis and the Cascadia subduction zone.  The proposed work will address fundamental and long-standing questions about the links between thermal, hydrologic and geodynamic processes and will advance discovery and understanding of this unique seep.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Three hypotheses on the source of these fluids will be tested: (1) that the fluids are meteoric and play no role in the seismogenic behavior of the margin but may contribute to element transport between land and ocean, impacting the current understanding of coastal hydrogeology; (2) that the fluids originate from smectite-illite dehydration in the accreted sediments, rather than at the plate boundary, providing important information on fluid production and overpressure development within the accretionary prism above the plate boundary; and (3) that the fluids originate from high temperature metamorphic reactions at depth in the seismogenic region of the CSZ, resulting in extreme overpressures at the plate boundary.  In the latter case, the dehydration reactions may explain the partially locked behavior of the fault in this part of the continental margin or suggest that the locked seismogenic zone may not correspond to moderate overpressures as postulated for other subduction zone areas such as Nankai. off Japan, and off Costa Rica. Hypotheses will be tested by detailed geological characterization of the seep site; by thoroughly analyzing the seep and pore fluids using major and trace element geochemistry; by examining the gas chemistry and by isotopic analyses; and by heat flow and modeling studies. The field program will utilize the remotely operated vehicle, Jason, and the autonomous underwater vehicle, Sentry, from the Woods Hole Oceanographic National Deep Submergence Facility to complete photomosaics of the seafloor as well as bathymetric maps around the seep sites at 1-m resolution. Seep fluids will be collected using isobaric gas-tight fluid-volatile samplers with real-time temperature measurements to determine end-member fluid compositions. All pore water samples will be analyzed for salinity, pH, and alkalinity shipboard, and a subset of samples will be analyzed for sulfate by shipboard ion chromatography. Approximately 300 samples will be analyzed for Cl, SO4, Br, Ca, Mg, Na, K, and alkalinity. Select samples will be analyzed for Li, Rb, Cs, Ba, DIC, and O/H isotopes. Si, NH4, as well as the methane through pentane concentrations in pore water and vent fluids will be analyzed. Stable isotope ratios of C, D, H, CH4, He, Li, and Cl will also be determined. Detailed heat flow measurements around the venting sites will be obtained to constrain relative changes in thermal gradients. Precisely located push cores for sediment chemical and physical property and pore water analyses will be collected and analyzed. Water column sensors on Sentry will also provide eH and CTD-O2-turbidity characterizations of the near-bottom fluids. Gravity coring will allow direct sampling of pore fluids below the zone of mixing with seawater and will ensure capture of the advecting fluid signal. Upward advection rates will be estimated from solute profiles using a new, non-steady-state, reaction-transport model. The spatial distribution of flow constructed from Jason push cores around the seep and shipboard gravity cores will be used to estimate output fluxes of fluid and solutes. The EM302 multibeam system on the R/V Thompson will be utilized for imaging of the bubble plumes to determine spatial extent with implications for biological activity in the upper water column. To determine local current regimes and hence the most intense plume locations in the water column, the hull-mounted 75 kHz ADCP will be used to log current velocities during all surveys."

Although smaller than the Pacific cold tongue, the Atlantic cold tongue is expansive, spanning several degrees latitude across the Equator and tens of degrees longitude. These cold tongues act as sinks for atmospheric heat and are critical to the global heat balance. The seasonal cycle in sea surface temperature varies in magnitude decreasing from east to west along the equator. Peak cooling occurs in boreal summer, first in the east and progressing westward. The Atlantic's cold tongue exerts considerable regional influence on both sides of the ocean, contributing to variable rainfall over Northeast Brazil and to weather patterns in densely populated areas of western Africa. However, measurements in the Atlantic cold tongue comparable to those made in the Pacific cold tongue do not presently exist. This project will close this gap and discern primary differences between the equatorial mixing regimes in the Pacific and Atlantic basins. A post-doctoral associate will participate in a broad analysis of the new observations and be trained in equatorial dynamics. Undergraduate engineering students will be employed in summer months to help with construction and testing of instrumentation. The Mary's Peak webcam will continue to be supported. This is a webcam installed on the roof of the Oceanography building at the Oregon State University that provides a visualization of natural fluid flows traced by clouds, providing an educational glimpse into fluid motions in the atmosphere. This project will also complement ongoing measurements in the Pacific cold tongue, theoretical analyses of Tropical Instability Waves, and ongoing international studies in the tropical Atlantic. The data set will be archived and shared with the community.<br/><br/>Away from the equator, the annual cycle in sea surface temperature (SST) is related to seasonally-varying solar heating. Despite the fact that the equatorial oceans are heated year round by the atmosphere, they also exhibit an annual cycle in SST. Recent, yet distinct, measurements in the equatorial cold tongues of both Pacific and Atlantic Oceans establish the dominant role that mixing plays in boreal summer cooling of the sea surface to produce this annual cycle in SST. At least two significant, and puzzling, differences exist between the two cold tongues. Firstly, measurements from the Atlantic show that the deep diurnal mixing cycle (below the mixed layer but above the core of the Equatorial Undercurrent), which is so critical to mixing in the upper equatorial Pacific, is not present in the Atlantic. Secondly, climate models predict a Pacific cold tongue that is too cool and an Atlantic cold tongue that is too warm. The now well-established PIRATA (Pilot Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic) array is providing new insight into equatorial Atlantic dynamics and its role in critical weather patterns on both sides of that ocean. This project will use it as the backbone to measure the vertical structure and short-time variability of cold tongue mixing in the Atlantic, for comparison to what has been learned from the Pacific cold tongue. Five newly-developed mixing meters (chi-pods) will each be deployed on two equatorial PIRATA moorings at 10W and 23W across the Atlantic cold tongue for a period of four years. These two moorings have dense upper ocean sampling, surface meteorology, and vertical profiles of ocean currents to complement the mixing measurements. These new observations will establish seasonal and inter-annual variations of cold tongue mixing and how it influences SST and the observed weakening of the Atlantic cold tongue, and also define the mechanisms for differences in Pacific and Atlantic mixing that creates the bipolar climate model responses in SST trends."

This project will continue the support and development of the Neotoma Paleoecology Database, a community data resource in which experts contribute their data, curate these data to meet community standards, and freely access and use the data in research and teaching. Examples of research that uses the Neotoma resource include understanding the causes and consequences of past extinction, assessing the sensitivity of species to large environmental changes that accompanied past ice ages, and measuring how quickly species adapt to past rapid environmental changes. Neotoma?s open data access will also facilitate new forms of education and outreach, by giving students and teachers direct access to research-quality data and empowering them to run their own analyses of past climate and biodiversity dynamics. This will help train the next generation of the scientific workforce, with crossover skills in both geological and data sciences.<br/><br/>Neotoma has become a research resource in paleoecology, paleoclimatology, macroecology, biogeography, and environmental archaeology, with rapid growth in data volume, kinds of data supported, and active third-party and externally-supported research projects. Gathering thousands of site-level records into high-quality, global-scale, data networks requires substantial effort. Datasets must be carefully checked, taxon names harmonized, age-depth models updated, and uncertainties quantified. Neotoma will continue to address these challenges through a model of centralized infrastructure and distributed data governance. Priorities for this project are: 1) establishing international coverage for data types and research communities that now have critical masses of trained data stewards and data volumes in North America (pollen, diatoms, ostracods, testate amoebae, vertebrates), and 2) establishing critical masses of data and data stewards for recently added data types (specimen-level stable isotopes, organic biomarkers). Cyberinfrastructure improvements will include: 1) a web-based interface for bulk-uploading metadata and data from many sites, 2) better support for specimen-level isotopic measurements, 3) better visualization and analytical support for micropaleontological species-environment calibration datasets, and 4) a rebuild of Neotoma?s home webpage. Sustainability priorities include: 1) support for the recently launched non-profit EarthLife Consortium Foundation, and 2) a workshop in which leaders from Neotoma and other community data resources will receive training in building strategic sustainability plans, learn tools to manage finances and plan for the future, develop strategies to diversify their funding base, and enhance communication skills. These updates and improvements to Neotoma will enhance the existing data resource for current users, and will help early-career researchers, for whom data availability and data-science training can open new career pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A key unanswered question is how Antarctic life will respond. If warmer waters contribute to fish disease susceptibility, then iconic Antarctic predators they support, including penguins, seals, and killer whales, will suffer. A recent scientific cruise on the Antarctic peninsula encountered a population of crowned notothen fish that were plagued by pink, wart-like tumors that covered 10% to 30% of the body surface on about a third of the animals. Similar tumors had not previously been reported, suggesting that this might be a new disease that threatens Antarctic fish. The goal of proposed work is to identify the biological origins of the tumor and how it affects cell function and organismal physiology. The work is potentially transformative because it studies what might be a harbinger of Antarctic fish responses to global climate change. The project has several Broader Impacts. First, it will publicize the tumors. Because Antarctic researchers have never reported a tumor epidemic, the community must become aware of the outbreak and the tumor?s distinct diagnostic features. Second, dissemination of project results will stir further research to determine if this is an isolated event or is becoming a general phenomenon, and thus a broad concern for Antarctic ecosystems. Third, assays the project develops to detect the disease will enhance research infrastructure. Finally, work will broaden the nation?s scientific workforce by providing authentic research experiences for high school students and undergraduates from groups underrepresented in scientific research. <br/><br/>The overall goal of proposed work is to identify the biological origins of the neoplasia and how it affects cell function and physiology. Aim 1 is to identify the pathogenic agent. Aim 1a is to test the hypothesis that a virus causes the neoplasia by isolating and sequencing viral nucleic acids from neoplasias and from animals that are not visibly affected. Aim 1b is to test neoplasias for bacteria, fungi, protozoa, or invertebrate parasites not present in healthy skin. Aim 2 is to learn how the disease alters the biology of affected cells. Aim 2a is to examine histological sections of affected and control tissues to see if the neoplasias are similar to previously reported skin diseases in temperate water fishes. Aim 2b is to examine the function of neoplastic cells by RNA-seq transcriptomics to identify genes that are differentially expressed in neoplasias and normal skin. Achieving these Aims will advance knowledge by identifying the causes and consequences of an outbreak of neoplasias in Antarctic fish. Proposed work is significant because it is the first to investigate a neoplasia cluster in Antarctic fish.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This places today's concentration of 400 parts per million in stark contrast.  Furthermore, these gas records show that natural sources of greenhouse gas such as oceans and ecosystems act as amplifiers of climate change by increasing emissions of gases during warmer periods.  Such amplification is expected to occur in the future, adding to the human-produced gas burden.  The South Pole ice core will build upon these prior findings by expanding the suite of gases to include, for the first time, those potent trace gases that both trapped heat and depleted ozone during the past 40,000 years.  The present project on inert gases and methane in the South Pole ice core will improve the dating of this crucial record, to unprecedented precision, so that the relative timing of events can be used to learn about the mechanism of trace gas production and destruction, and consequent climate change amplification.  Ultimately, this information will inform predictions of future atmospheric chemical cleansing mechanisms and climate in the context of our rapidly changing atmosphere.  This award also engages young people in the excitement of discovery and polar research, helping to entrain the next generations of scientists and educators.  Education of graduate students, a young researcher (Buizert), and training of technicians, will add to the nation?s human resource base.   <br/> <br/>This award funds the construction of the gas chronology for the South Pole 1500m ice core, using measured inert gases (d15N and d40Ar--Nitrogen and Argon isotope ratios, respectively) and methane in combination with a next-generation firn densification model that treats the stochastic nature of air trapping and the role of impurities on densification.  The project addresses fundamental gaps in scientific understanding that limit the accuracy of gas chronologies, specifically a poor knowledge of the controls on ice-core d15N and the possible role of layering and impurities in firn densification.  These gaps will be addressed by studying the gas enclosure process in modern firn at the deep core site.  The work will comprise the first-ever firn air pumping experiment that has tightly co-located measurements of firn structural properties on the core taken from the same borehole.<br/><br/>The project will test the hypothesis that the lock-in horizon as defined by firn air d15N, CO2, and methane is structurally controlled by impermeable layers, which are in turn created by high-impurity content horizons in which densification is enhanced.  Thermal signals will be sought using the inert gas measurements, which improve the temperature record with benefits to the firn densification modeling.  Neon, argon, and oxygen will be measured in firn air and a limited number of deep core samples to test whether glacial period layering was enhanced, which could explain low observed d15N in the last glacial period.  Drawing on separate volcanic and methane synchronization to well-dated ice cores to create independent ice and gas tie points, independent empirical estimates of the gas age-ice age difference will be made to check the validity of the firn densification model-inert gas approach to calculating the gas age-ice age difference.  These points will also be used to test whether the anomalously low d15N seen during the last glacial period in east Antarctic ice cores is due to deep air convection in the firn, or a missing impurity dependence in the firn densification models.  <br/><br/>The increased physical understanding gained from these studies, combined with new high-precision measurements, will lead to improved accuracy of the gas chronology of the South Pole ice core, which will enhance the overall science return from this gas-oriented core.  This will lead to clarification of timing of atmospheric gas variations and temperature, and aid in efforts to understand the biogeochemical feedbacks among trace gases.  These feedbacks bear on the future response of the Earth System to anthropogenic forcing.  Ozone-depleting substances will be measured in the South Pole ice core record, and a precise gas chronology will add value.  Lastly, by seeking a better understanding of the physics of gas entrapment, the project aims to have an impact on ice-core science in general."
