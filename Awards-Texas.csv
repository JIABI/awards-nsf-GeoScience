Additionally, the lack of data and standard methodologies makes it more challenging to assess transportation network resilience in real-time during flood disasters. To address these challenges, this project aims to integrate novel data streams from both physical sensor networks (e.g., remotely-sensed data using unmanned aerial vehicles [UAVs]), and citizen sensor networks (e.g., crowdsourced traffic data, social media and community responsive teams connected through a developed mobile app). The goal is to develop a framework for real-time assessment of damage and the resilience of urban transportation infrastructures after coastal floods via the state-of-the-art computer vision, deep learning and data fusion technologies. The project will also advance Data Science through multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional collaborations. The project is expected to improve the sustainability, resilience, livability, and general well-being of coastal communities by having a direct impact on the effectiveness, capability, and potential of using both physical and social sensor data. This will in turn enable and transform damage assessments, and identify critical and vulnerable components in transportation networks in a more effective and efficient manner. The interdisciplinary research team, along with students and collaborators from different coastal regions, will facilitate the sharing of knowledge and technologies from different socio-environmental contexts and testing the transferability of the research outcomes.<br/><br/>The project will harmonize physical and citizen sensors within a geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) data-fusion framework with a focus on three research thrusts: (1) unsupervised flood extent detection by integrating UAV images collected throughout this project with existing geospatial data (e.g., road networks and building footprints); (2) flood depth estimation using deep learning and computer vision techniques combined with crowdsourced photos and UAV imagery; and (3) assessment of the impact on and resilience of transportation networks based on near real-time flood and damage information. The innovative methodology will be demonstrated and deployed through collaborative efforts in response to future flood events as well as several historical storms. The project will produce open-source algorithms for future educational use, raw and processed datasets and associated processing software, a mobile app to engage community responsive science teams, and three research publications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Geoscience problems are complex and often involve data that changes across space and time. Frequently geoscience knowledge and understanding provides valuable information and insight for problems related to energy, water, climate, agriculture, mineral resources, and our understanding of how the Earth evolves through time. Simultaneously, many grand challenges in the geosciences cannot be addressed without the aid of computational support and innovations. Intelligent and Information Systems (IS) research in computer science includes a broad range of topics and computational methods such as knowledge representation, information integration, machine learning, robotics, adaptive sensors, and intelligent interfaces. IS research has an important role to play in accelerating the speed of scientific discovery in geosciences and thus in solving challenges that cannot be addressed by other means. Similarly, many aspects of Geosciences (GEO) research pose novel large-scale problems for IS researchers to improve and validate their methods. Intelligent Systems for Geosciences (IS-GEO) represent an emerging community of interdisciplinary researchers producing fundamental new capabilities for understanding Earth systems and how the application of IS technologies can cultivate key new developments in both fields.<br/><br/>The EarthCube Research Coordination Network for Intelligent Systems for Geosciences (IS-GEO RCN) will catalyze collaborations to enable advances in our understanding of Earth systems through innovative applications of intelligent and information systems to fundamental geosciences problems. The goal of the IS-GEO RCN is to leverage expertise and generate interactions between both the geosciences and computing sciences communities to provide advanced scientific capabilities. To enable the network, the IS-GEO RCN will host meetings and other activities that: (1) foster an active and broad-based community across GEO and IIS areas; (2) identify barriers to research, such as terminology differences among the disciplines involved and highlight knowledge gaps that hinder collaboration across the disciplines; (3) establish and enhance communication channels between GEO and IS researchers; (4) defining grand challenges in geosciences that are well suited to IS techniques; and (5) encourage robust, long-term collaborations.  Furthermore, the educational component aims to identify new approaches to teaching students in this new interdisciplinary area, seeking to raise a new generation of scientists that are better able to apply IS methods and tools to geoscience challenges of the future. By providing avenues for IS and GEO researchers to work together the IS-GEO RCN will serve as both a point of contact, as well as an avenue for educational outreach across the disciplines for the nascent community of research and practice.<br/> <br/>The initial efforts are focused on connecting the communities in ways that help researchers understand opportunities and challenges that can benefit from IS-GEO collaborations. The uncertain, heterogeneous and disparate nature of geoscience data paired with recent IS advances and increases in observational data offer unique opportunities for new approaches and discoveries through joint efforts. The IS-GEO RCN will jumpstart interdisciplinary research collaborations in this emerging new area so that progress across both disciplines can be accelerated."

Moodie has been awarded an NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out research and education plans at The University of Texas at Austin and Stanford University in collaboration with mentors Dr. Paola Passalacqua and Dr. Jef Caers respectively. This study aims to investigate the properties of sedimentary rocks across multiple scales, to draw connections between large scale geological variability (~10 m) and smaller-scale variability (~10 cm). Geophysical imaging is unable to resolve small-scale geological variability, however, Dr. Moodie expects to constrain this variability using statistical models and observations of larger-scale variability. This research is critical to the sustainability of coastal river-deltas, because these environments are impacted by a limited understanding of subsurface geology and flow pathways that are controlled by small-scale geological variability. Improved understanding of fluid-flow pathways will influence many fields, in particular, results of this research will inform pollutant transport modeling, groundwater resource management, shallow geothermal and carbon sequestration operations, as well as hydrocarbon production. Dr. Moodie?s education plan includes mentoring students, organizing a reading seminar about machine learning in the geosciences, and developing active learning modules for topics in sedimentary rock stratigraphy. <br/><br/>The sustainability of coastal river-deltas is impacted by a multitude of natural and anthropogenic factors, including a limited understanding of subsurface flow patterns. Geological heterogeneity strongly influences flow pathways and thus rates of contaminant transport and groundwater aquifer recharge, which limits our ability to sustainably manage water resources and mitigate health risks in river-delta environments. Smaller-scale subsurface heterogeneity due to channel and bedform dynamics (of less than 1 m) is typically under-constrained, because it is below the resolution that can be imaged by existing geophysical techniques. Theory and some evidence suggest that stratigraphic sequences may be scale invariant, which opens a pathway to constrain smaller-scale heterogeneity via observation of larger-scale heterogeneity. This project directly addresses the question: can patterns and information gleaned from subsurface heterogeneity at one spatial scale be used to constrain uncertainty at another scale? The EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship, will allow Dr. Moodie to 1) rigorously investigate scale invariant properties of stratigraphy, and 2) integrate these findings into a quantitative method to constrain subsurface heterogeneity. He will use a combination of approaches, including field measurement, numerical modeling, statistical data analysis, and machine learning. Measures from information theory will quantify scale invariance in stratigraphy, and an existing generative adversarial neural network method will be modified to map heterogeneity across spatial scales. This project was co-funded by the Sedimentary Geology and Paleobiology program in the Earth Science division (EAR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These microstructures help to explain phenomena that occur at the scale of mountains and tectonic plates.  Interpretation of microstructures formed in nature during deformation is aided by comparison with those formed during experiments, under known conditions of pressure, temperature, stress, strain and strain rate, and experimental rock deformation benefits from the ground truth offered through comparison with rocks deformed in nature.  However, the ability to search for relevant naturally or experimentally deformed microstructures is hindered by the lack of any database that contains these data.  The researchers collaborating on this project will develop a single digital data system for rock microstructures to facilitate the critical interaction between and among the communities that study naturally and experimentally deformed rocks.  To aid in the comparison of microstructures formed in nature and experiment, the researchers will link to commonly used analytical tools and develop a pilot project for automatic comparison of microstructures using machine learning.   <br/><br/>Rock microstructures relate processes at the microscopic scale to phenomena at the outcrop, orogen, and plate scales and reveal the relationships among stress, strain, and strain rate.  Quantitative rheological information is obtained through linked studies of naturally formed microstructures with those created during rock deformation experiments under known conditions.  The project will develop a single digital data system for both naturally and experimentally deformed rock microstructure data to facilitate comparison of microstructures from different environments.  A linked data system will facilitate interaction between practitioners of experimental deformation, those studying natural deformation and the cyberscience community.  The data system will leverage the StraboSpot data system currently under development in Structural Geology and Tectonics.  To develop this system requires: 1) Modification of the StraboSpot data system to accept microstructural data from both naturally and experimentally deformed rocks; and 2) Linking the microstructural data to its geologic context ? either in nature, or its experimental data/parameters.  The researchers will engage the rock deformation community with the goal of establishing data standards and protocols for data collection, and integrate our work with ongoing efforts to establish protocols and techniques for automated metadata collection and digital data storage.  To analyze the microstructures studied and/or generated by these communities, we will ensure StraboSpot data output is compatible with commonly used microstructural tools.  They will develop a pilot project for comparing and analyzing microstructures from different environments using machine-learning."

Sedimentary geology relies on a set of patterns in rock outcrops that provide information on where natural environments (like oceans, rivers, deserts, or lakes) existed in the past. This project will develop tools for automated interpretation of past environments from sedimentary outcrop data. Collaborative evaluation of outcrop datasets by geoscientists and computer scientists will yield new perspectives on how geological outcrop interpretation can be accomplished and provide a deeper understanding of the information required for automated interpretation of field data. Automating outcrop interpretation will broaden researchers? ability to rapidly mine existing and new digital datasets for information that will contribute new insights into the history of surface conditions on Earth and Mars. The tools developed as part of this project will be broadly disseminated and will integrate with existing digital platforms for field data. These tools will help facilitate collaborations among a broad range of geoscientists, including those who can?t easily conduct fieldwork in remote locations. This project will strengthen workforce development by cross-training sedimentary geologists with advanced computer science skills and will provide examples of practical applications of machine-learning approaches for computer science students.<br/><br/>To accomplish these goals, this project will leverage existing digital outcrop datasets and collect a new targeted dataset to explore automated approaches for extracting sedimentary features from outcrop image and surface-topography data. The project will focus on extracting sedimentary features that are critical for paleoenvironmental reconstruction, including types of cross bedding, and investigate how outcrop quality, scale, and orientation influence the recoverability of sedimentary features. Additionally, this project will explore the degree to which the three-dimensional orientation of sedimentary features can be extrapolated from automated outcrop observations. The tools developed in this project will be tested with structural geology and geomorphology outcrop datasets to evaluate how workflows developed as part of this work could aid a broader range of geoscience disciplines. Results will be packaged as an accessible online tool that can be used in combination with digital field data repositories. Widespread dissemination of this tool and broad community participation will strengthen the algorithm and improve the community resource over time.

This research will use large-scale field experiments to help understand how and why fish populations respond to fragmentation of seagrass habitats. The question is complex because increased fragmentation in seagrass beds decreases the amount and also the configuration of the habitat (one patch splits into many, patches become further apart, the amount of edge increases, etc). Previous work by the investigators in natural seagrass meadows provided evidence that fragmentation interacts with amount of habitat to influence the community dynamics of fishes in coastal marine landscapes. Specifically, fragmentation had no effect when the habitat was large, but had a negative effect when habitat was smaller. In this study, the investigators will build artificial seagrass habitat to use in a series of manipulative field experiments at an ambitious scale. The results will provide new, more specific information about how coastal fish community dynamics are affected by changes in overall amount and fragmentation of seagrass habitat, in concert with factors such as disturbance, larval dispersal, and wave energy. The project will support two early-career investigators, inform habitat conservation strategies for coastal management, and provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. The investigators plan to target students from underrepresented groups for the research opportunities. <br/><br/>Building on previous research in seagrass environments, this research will conduct a series of field experiments approach at novel, yet relevant scales, to test how habitat area and fragmentation affect fish diversity and productivity. Specifically, 15 by 15-m seagrass beds will be created using artificial seagrass units (ASUs) that control for within-patch-level (~1-10 m2) factors such as shoot density and length. The investigators will employ ASUs to manipulate total habitat area and the degree of fragmentation within seagrass beds in a temperate estuary in North Carolina. In year one, response of the fishes that colonize these landscapes will be measured as abundance, biomass, community structure, as well as taxonomic and functional diversity. Targeted ASU removals will then follow to determine species-specific responses to habitat disturbance. In year two, the landscape array and sampling regime will be doubled, and half of the landscapes will be seeded with post-larval fish of low dispersal ability to test whether pre- or post-recruitment processes drive landscape-scale patterns. In year three, the role of wave exposure (a natural driver of seagrass fragmentation) in mediating fish community response to landscape configuration will be tested by deploying ASU meadows across low and high energy environments."

Predictions of mass loss over the coming century have been hampered by large discord between current-generation ice sheet models. Major challenges are the lack of suitable observational constraints for model calibration and accurate histories of past surface climates that may serve as surface forcing boundary conditions in ice sheet model simulations. This project addresses these challenges through the use of observational data in the form of stratigraphic horizons of constant age that have been imaged by numerous ice-penetrating radar surveys, which serve as a data-constraints on the past flow and boundary conditions of an ice sheet model. The method developed will provide a novel approach for rigorous ice sheet calibration and initialization. Beyond the scientific application that is targeted at past climate reconstruction from ice sheet internal data, the infrastructure to enable this will be publicly available to the community, being based on the open-source ice sheet model. The project will support the transition of a female early-career scientist into an independent research career.<br/><br/>Solving the state and parameter estimation problem as a terminal constraint control problem enables us to make several key scientific advances: (i) develop a time-evolving GrIS state that is consistent with the time history encapsulated in the age layer data; (ii) jointly invert for a set of optimal model parameters (i.e., model calibration) and time-varying optimal surface forcings that are consistent with the underlying ice sheet evolution (i.e., reconstruction of a consistent climate forcing history); and (iii) develop a realistic transient simulation of the ice sheet over the Holocene period, leading into a present state that may serve as well-balanced initial condition for prediction, and for which initialization shocks or artificial model drift are expected to be minimal, by construction. A key computational ingredient that enables the proposed work is the development of a time-dependent adjoint model of an ice sheet model that is able to evolve internal ice age structures. We propose to accomplish this by means of algorithmic differentiation (AD) with the open-source tool OpenAD, applied to the SImulation COde for POLythermal Ice Sheets (SICOPOLIS) model. This reconstruction of past ice flow and the boundary conditions of the Greenland Ice Sheet is necessary to reproduce the observed ages (from ice cores) and also enables us to test with finer spatio-temporal detail the onset of important past climatic events, including the Holocene Climatic Optimum and the Little Ice Age. Exactly how, when, and where these events may be recovered by this state estimate will shed light on how the GrIS responds to rapid changes in climate, both in its entirety and regionally.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mesopelagic or ""twilight"" zone encompasses depths from 200 to 1000 meters where sunlight is dim. This vast region plays a key role in regulating ocean chemistry and biology, which in turn strongly effects global climate. The mesopelagic zone holds much of our planet's fish populations as well as poorly understood processes that couple the ocean surface to the seafloor including vertical fluxes of plankton, organic and inorganic particles, bubbles, and droplets. Mesopelagic features are often mobile, patchy, and ephemeral, so surveys and sampling can be very difficult.  Recent studies have found that mesopelagic biomass including fish are dramatically underestimated, yet investigations of patterns and processes in this region are strongly constrained by available technology.<br/><br/>This program will produce a unique new robot that will enable unprecedented scientific access to midwater environments, complementing existing survey and sampling tools. The robot will use cameras, lights, and oceanographic sensors to autonomously track slow-moving individual targets such as migrating mid-water animals, descending particles, and rising bubbles and droplets without disturbing those targets. It will also have the ability to detect and follow fine-scale oceanographic features such as thin layers that hold critical nutrients. Finally, the robot will take samples utilizing on-board intelligence to determine precisely when and where to sample.

The proposed research program has two primary goals: (1) learn about the physics of the almost entirely unexplored regime of very high temperature, low density plasma in the solar corona; and, (2) use what is learned to find strong constraints on the properties of coronal heating.  The program of research presents the opportunity to study a new regime of thermal energy transport, in which the global structure of the plasma must be considered, and to determine how it affects the overall energy balance of the Sun's upper atmosphere.  This will be of value to other areas of space plasma physics.  By combining what is learned from the hot emission with what is already known from the warm emission, strong constraints will be placed on the properties of coronal heating.<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this CAREER project target students at all levels as well as educators.  The physics' topics on which this research is based will be incorporated into the solar astrophysics graduate course taught by the PI, from which a graduate student will be recruited specifically to work on this project.  The program also provides opportunities for undergraduate participation in research.  A major part of this project is a summer school program on key physical science concepts, taught within the context of the Sun, for rising juniors and seniors in the Houston Independent School District, which educates predominantly minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged students.  The mode of teaching will be through peer instruction and mentoring in small groups.

Even given the same climate forcings, LSMs predict different surface fluxes and soil moisture conditions. This is due to differences in the formulations of individual processes, parameterizations of those formulations, numerical solution methods and representation of spatial heterogeneity. All of these differences contribute to LSM prediction errors and uncertainty.  Increasing confidence in climate predictions requires revisiting fundamental process understanding and using that understanding to improve representations of land-atmosphere feedbacks. This research seeks to address this challenge by answering questions on multiphase fluid transport mechanisms in surface soils and mass/energy exchange at the soil-atmosphere interface. New knowledge and modeling approaches will result in improved predictions for water supply and food security as well as environmental issues across the nation. Linked to the research plan is an educational framework for engaging minority middle school students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).  Focusing on the integrating theme of water and climate, the investigator will help students make the link between STEM they learn in the classroom and environmental water resource problems in their own backyards, motivating and preparing students to pursue college studies and ultimately careers in STEM fields. The integrated activities will help to build a scientifically literate and informed citizenry, while also answering critical water and climate questions. This project will contribute substantially to the goals of the NSF in the production of interdisciplinary knowledge and the education of middle-school students, young scientists and engineers. <br/><br/> The overarching goal of this research is to advance our understanding and modeling of mass and energy exchange at the land-atmosphere interface over a wide range of scales, and ultimately improve LSMs that are utilized in global climate prediction. The proposed research will systematically explore how the shallow subsurface and the atmosphere, specifically the layer very close to the soil surface, interact, providing new insights into mass and thermal flux process interactions that will be integrated into LSMs. A focus on scaling based on process understanding at multiple scales will allow for process-rich parameterizations for multiple land-atmosphere interaction and subsurface processes that contribute to LSMs. This vision includes unique highly controlled mechanistic studies in the laboratory, leveraging of existing laboratory and field data, modeling of critical mass and energy dynamics, and the characterization of important interactions from the laboratory to the watershed scales that drive feedbacks to climate systems. Project results will yield unique, high-fidelity data that will greatly aid in improving our understanding and modeling of the processes affected by heterogeneity at various scales and the development of methods to mechanistically represent the proposed processes at the watershed scale. A suite of climate intermediate, and fine scale computational models will be used to guide observations and interpret data; process studies will provide new algorithms and process parameterizations and evaluate model performance. Computational models in conjunction with experimental data will enable the investigator to understand governing flow and transport mechanisms under different atmospheric forcing at different scales.  This research is expected to improve the representation of mass and energy exchange processes across multiple scales at the soil-land-atmosphere interface."

More accurate projections of future climate scenarios will require a more detailed understanding of how fast natural processes can remove from Earth's atmosphere the pulse of carbon dioxide that is being produced by society in the industrial era. Models of these processes predict a long tail of the pulse of human-produced carbon dioxide, suggesting that this carbon will have a long-term impact on our climate and society.  As these processes play out over relatively long timescales, such predictions can be verified by looking to the geological record of past events. This project will provide a high-resolution reconstruction of how an ancient natural pulse of carbon dioxide injected into the atmosphere was neutralized by the Earth system in the geological past. As such, this study will provide important perspective from the past on the present rate at which atmospheric carbon can be taken up by natural processes, and hence help Earth scientists make more accurate projections of future climate change.  The researchers will also work with a Geoscience summer residence camp for high school students and non-science major undergraduate students will participate in experiential learning in the field on the impact of climate change. Both activities will contribute to bringing students with diverse backgrounds into STEM and geoscience career paths.<br/>This research will evaluate the evolution of atmospheric CO2 on decadal timescales following a rapid pulse of large amounts of carbon dioxide injected into the atmosphere during volcanic eruptions that was part of the Columbia River Basalt Group in the US Pacific Northwest.  At the same time as these eruptions and nearby in northern Idaho, an ancient lake (Miocene Lake Clarkia) was formed when basalt flows presumably dammed a local drainage system.  Sediments that began to accumulate in the newly formed Lake Clarkia preserve a history of these events in the geological record that can be used to evaluate, in high-resolution, the evolution of the spike of atmospheric CO2 concentrations that resulted from the volcanic eruptions.  The researchers will use micro-XRF scanning of elemental distributions to focus their study on the unoxidized, varve-like sediments.  They will reconstruct the evolution of this natural pulse of CO2 using the properties of stomatal pores in fossil leaves preserved in the sediments, combined with information from the stable isotopes of carbon preserved in the fossil organic matter.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Carlson to carry out research and education activities under the mentorship of Dr. Irina Overeem at the University of Colorado, Boulder. The project seeks to assess how enhanced sediment supply from melting ice sheets and glaciers, and thawing permafrost impacts the growth of Arctic deltas. The sand delivered to Arctic deltas, particularly those in West Greenland, is recognized as a potential resource for coastal restoration efforts and for industrial use (primarily concrete production) worldwide. This project will investigate the processes that control sediment retention along Arctic coastlines using field observations and remote sensing. This work will inform policy and economic decisions for sand-use in Greenland. Furthermore, the information gained from this project will be used to develop a learning module geared toward introductory undergraduate students that allows the user to explore controls on delta growth. The model will be housed at SedEdu, which is a suite of educational tools related to geomorphology and sedimentology.<br/><br/><br/>Subaqueous delta-front sediment transport processes are an important control on coastal evolution. Rivers and subaqueous density flows are the largest mechanisms for sediment redistribution on Earth's surface. Subaerial coastal evolution is easily-observable through historical and satellite imagery, however quantifying subaqueous sediment movement is inherently difficult because it typically requires observation in the field. Delta-front sediment transport processes become especially important to consider for rapidly growing deltas with high sedimentation rates. Under warming climate conditions, Arctic deltas, particularly those in Greenland, are rapidly growing as they receive enhanced sediment supply from melting and retreating glaciers and thawing permafrost. While there is evidence for delta-front failures that transport substantial volumes of sediment, it is unclear to what degree they influence delta progradation rates and sediment retention along coastlines. This study links readily observable data (images of subaerial delta activity) to subaqueous sediment transport processes. The objectives of this study are to determine how subaerial delta activity links to sediment transport at the subaqueous delta front and how enhanced sediment supply impacts marine sediment transport processes on Arctic deltas. In turn, the influence of delta-front failures on delta topset dynamics will be evaluated. These questions will be addressed over different temporal and spatial scales. Dr. Carlson will evaluate individual delta-front transport events at one field location during variable discharge conditions, using repeat bathymetric data. During this field campaign, changes in the subaerial delta topset (e.g. wetted area) will be evaluated using satellite imagery. Correlations between delta topset activity and delta-front transport timing/location will be used to infer relationships under past conditions (evaluated using 34 years of Landsat data) and to consider delta-front sediment transport under future conditions (e.g. how do Arctic delta-front failures vary under higher water and sediment discharge conditions in a waring climate?). These findings may offer insight into the conditions and potential effects of shifting sediment delivery for other fjord deltas in Greenland.

Long-lasting international collaborative research and education programs are necessary to advance understanding of earthquake source physics and transfer the knowledge from the past events to future generations. To advance understanding of deformation and slip behaviors of megathrust plate boundary faults and physics of earthquakes in subduction zones, this project involves development of innovative deformation and friction experiments on natural fault rocks at elevated pressure and temperature conditions that are anticipated along the plate boundary faults. To expand students' learning opportunities on experimental rock deformation and subduction zone earthquake and tsunami hazards, the principal investigator develops new education programs including a senior capstone course, a training course for graduate students and early-career scientists in geoscience and engineering, and an international field trip that will educate students on subduction zone earthquakes and tsunamis and hazard mitigation for natural disasters. The education programs are designed to provide hands-on laboratory experience in rock deformation and insights into subduction zone earthquakes. Trough these programs, next-generation researchers will be trained to facilitate interdisciplinary and international collaborations on tectonic, geodynamic, and engineering problems and to advance the transfer of discovery and natural hazard mitigation to future generations. <br/><br/>Development of elevated pore fluid pressure along the megathrust plate boundary faults and thus low strength of faults are inferred from many geophysical and geological observations including low seismic velocity, high reflectivity taper angle of the accretionary prism wedge, and vein formation. This project will test the hypothesis that deformation and slip behaviors at low effective stress may control a spectrum of slip events and earthquakes observed along the megathrust plate boundary faults. A series of true-triaxial compression tests, conventional triaxial extension tests, and triaxial friction experiments under controlled pore pressure will be conducted on natural megathrust fault rocks. Low effective pressure at a range of loading paths and rates will be achieved by controlling of magnitude and pressurization rates of pore pressure. The series of experiments will document the effects of elevated pore pressure and loading paths and rates on the formation of shear, extensional, and hybrid extension-shear fracture and frictional behaviors, and thus can provide mechanical perspectives on vein formation associated with slip along the plate boundary faults.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plate tectonics describes how the surface of the earth moves and has been very successful providing an understanding of the occurrence of most earthquakes and volcanic eruptions on the surface of Earth. One of the key aspects of plate tectonics is subduction when the cold plate (which is relatively dense) dips beneath another. A puzzling element of this is that new subduction zones must start where none existed in the past. The purpose of this project is to understand how a new subduction zone starts. The region selected for this study is the only known location on Earth where we can see a new subduction zone. The first target of study is the Australian plate as it first dives into Earth's interior. The second target is the new fault that defines the boundary between the Australian and the Pacific plates. All of the data collected will be integrated into a dynamic model of the formation of a new subduction zone and how the forces operate and change. Students from both the University of Texas and the California Institute of Technology will get valuable experience at sea learning about data collection, computational techniques, and data interpretation. New Zealand scientists will conduct onshore seismic recordings on the nature of the over-riding plate concurrent with this experiment. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The project is an integrated, active-source seismic experiment on the Puysegur-Fiordland boundary south of South Island of New Zealand. The study will test the hypothesis that this type-example of incipient subduction is making a transition from a forced to a self-sustaining state. The project was motivated to understand the forces that drive subduction, specifically by models that suggest that during subduction initiation there is a fundamental transition from far-field plate stresses to the negative buoyancy of the slab. The subduction zone selected is a segment of the Macquarie Ridge Complex (the boundary between the Australian and Pacific plates), and is likely the best margin globally to study the early stages of subduction. The team will address several fundamental questions including: What controls the transition from a forced to self-sustaining state during subduction initiation? And, what are the mechanical conditions of the oceanic plate during incipient subduction? The PIs will test the hypothesize that a strengthening of the slab pull force causes the subsidence along the ridge. This plate tectonic scenario will be addressed with refined gravity models of the Puysegur region and seismic constraints on the crustal structure and sedimentary basin history. Moreover, initially steep fracture zones and normal faults transition or evolve to shallow thrust planes during subduction initiation, key aspects of the geodynamics. The project is guided by forward modeling of the seismic source-receiver configuration that shows that the dip and other features of the slab at two positions along strike, each with a different degree of compression, will be resolvable with the seismic methods employed."

A number of processes have been proposed for this so-called Arctic polar amplification. While sea ice is known to play an important role on reflecting solar radiation and altering the Earth?s surface temperature, the roles of other processes are difficult to quantify. Especially, contributions from atmospheric mechanisms associated with ice-nucleating particles (INP; a few in a million aerosol particles below -20 C) and ice-involved clouds remain uncertain in the Arctic. This project aims to fill the gap by investigating the sources (natural/manmade), atmospheric abundance/budget, chemical composition and physical properties of INPs in the Atlantic sector of the Arctic. Moreover, the large measurement uncertainties in number concentrations, chemical composition and sources of INPs are problematic for modeling real-life phenomena. This research targets minimizing the measurement uncertainties and addresses this critical deficiency through a series of studies that involve direct collection of ice-nucleating particles and their residuals. To characterize Arctic ice-nucleating particles, a novel portable ice nucleation experiment chamber and a cold stage-supported droplet freezing assay will be used to obtain freezing temperature spectra of airborne particle samples. A new inertial ice particle separation technique will be used to collect ice crystal residuals relevant to the Arctic ice-involved clouds. The subsequent offline microspectroscopic characterization of ice crystal residuals and ambient aerosol particles will reveal the relative importance of aerosol physicochemical properties to particle size in ice nucleation. Ultimately, the measurements of INPs and ice crystal residuals from this research will be parameterized and translated to describe the time-resolved freezing ability of the particles as a function of temperature, their composition, water activity parameters and other physicochemical properties. Finally, an integration of research and education is the most important target of this project. This project will involve two graduate and several undergraduate students in research, curriculum development and outreach, as these are learning experiences that can aid in their professional development. This project will also develop hands-on curricular modules integrated with the proposed research to teach environmental and climate science to the general public, promote college courses and train future scientists.<br/><br/>Currently, there is a critical deficiency in Arctic field data regarding the abundance and composition of atmospheric ice-nucleating particles at temperatures above -15 C. This project will fill this gap by experimentally elucidating abundance and physicochemical properties of ice-nucleating particles. State-of-the-art representations of high-temperature INPs from the Atlantic sector of the Arctic will advance the atmospheric modeling community?s knowledge of the ice nucleation processes and its formulation in the Earth?s energy balance. The project also aims to provide robust and well-characterized INP measurements that will be archived in the publicly available university database. The measurements from this project, in collaboration with the existing transnational Arctic research community, will improve the understanding of the nature of aerosols, and the INP parameterizations representative of the Ny-lesund site will dramatically improve the understanding of ice formation processes that are currently very poorly represented in climate models.

ACC students will conduct research at a laboratory in the department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering (UT PGE). The research experience will begin with guided scientific ocean drilling investigations supported by class explanation, group meetings and related scientific reading assignments. As students identify research topics, lab equipment and procedures, student teams will research more independently. Students will present their research in-lieu of a final exam and also have opportunities to present their work at a local and/or national conference.

One such event occurred during the Early Jurassic about 183 million years ago when reefs experienced major extinctions during periods of warm, low-oxygen, acidic oceans. This Early Jurassic event is recorded in great detail in the Moroccan High Atlas Mountains, and research there is establishing (1) when ecosystems disappeared; (2) which organisms survived (and which did not), and (3) what environmental changes led to ecosystem collapse. To share this work with the public, a board game is being designed to educate players about Jurassic reefs, evolution, and extinction in the face of extreme environmental change. This game is integrated into middle school, high school, and college-level educational modules; it can also be enjoyed by the general public and will be made available in multiple languages, thus enhancing science literacy, both locally and internationally.<br/><br/>The primary research questions being addressed are: (1) When precisely does ecosystem collapse occur in the Early Jurassic and was it synchronous across ecosystem types (i.e., reefs versus level-bottom communities)? (2) What kill mechanism(s) (e.g., anoxia, acidification) caused biotic collapse and are they linked to large igneous province emplacement? (3) What were the timing and tempo of recovery for marine communities? These issues will be answered through field-based, interdisciplinary research in the Moroccan High Atlas. Quantitative paleoecological and sedimentological surveys are being combined with a suite of geochemical data (e.g., proxies for temperature, volcanism, and water oxygen levels) to understand the causes, timing, and consequences of biotic collapse in the Early Jurassic. This integrated, multi-disciplinary synthesis is informing paleontologists, ecologists, and climate scientists about the conditions that allowed certain ecosystems to survive a major global catastrophe. The educational efficacy of the board game is assessed through beta trials in local schools and universities with self-reported surveys of enjoyment and learning outcomes from both students and teachers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will address the roles of tectonic cycles and the accretion of oceanic crust in regulating episodes of magmatism, crustal thickening, and basin subsidence along ocean-continent subduction margins.  The project will integrate results from a regional traverse across several sedimentary basins with the record of magmatism across Ecuador, the narrowest segment of the Andes.  A range of analytical techniques will be employed to determine the timing of major shifts in basin development, sediment sources, and past drainages, and to recognize periods of crustal thickening, changes in sources of magmatism, and the influence of accreted oceanic crust.  The study will provide insights into the geologic processes and geohazards along ocean-continent subduction plate boundaries, offering information that will benefit society by improving risk assessment and infrastructure planning.  The project will also catalyze new academic collaborations within the framework of international learning experiences that will facilitate longer term collaborations between US and Ecuadorian researchers, including development of shared undergraduate and graduate geoscience field-course and field-trip opportunities.<br/><br/>Over the past decade, competing perspectives have emerged on the tectonic evolution of Cordilleran ocean-continent plate boundaries, including the geologic history of the Andes, the global archetype for Cordilleran convergent systems.  Debate largely originates from contrasting emphases on different regions (forearc vs. retroarc) and different components (basins vs. magmatic arc vs. fold-thrust belt) of Cordilleran systems.  This project will incorporate analytical techniques, such as sedimentary basin analysis, isotope geochemistry, petrology, and U-Pb geochronology, to identify potentially coupled episodic phases of basin evolution and arc magmatism that may be linked to internally driven orogenic processes (including underthrusting, high-flux magmatism, and buildup then foundering of crustal/lithospheric roots), or externally driven tectonic processes including fluctuating slab dynamics (cycles of subduction shallowing vs. steepening and associated rapid vs. diminished shortening and subsidence) and oceanic terrane accretion.  Ecuador contains an important yet underappreciated record of tectonic quiescence or possible extension during what has been long regarded as uninterrupted Cenozoic shortening, thickening, and uplift along the entire Andean margin.

In these areas, intensive irrigation, coupled with high evapotranspiration and limited groundwater recharge, has led to accumulation of pedogenic carbonate and production of abiotic CO2 in agricultural lands. This project will be among the first to quantify such an abiotic CO2 efflux, and to define key linkages between flood irrigation, salt loading and soil-atmosphere CO2 exchange in desert agricultural soils. This project is transformative in that it examines how pedogenic carbonate formation in irrigated agricultural systems, an under-studied process but continuously magnified by human activities, impacts C cycling in one of the largest biomes on Earth. More importantly, this project has significant socioeconomic relevance at global scales, because irrigation-induced salt accumulation and elevated CO2 efflux need to be remediated through improved agricultural practice and management. This project is also highly relevant for advancing STEM education to representative population of the southwestern U.S. It will provide interdisciplinary training opportunities in Critical Zone Science, environmental geophysics and isotope geochemistry, and advanced sensor technology for both graduate and undergraduate students from primarily under-represented groups at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) where 80% of student body is Hispanic. This project will directly support two Ph.D. and four undergraduate students, and provide field experience and learning opportunities to environmental science and geology majors, including two-week summer field trips. For education and outreach, hands-on activities will be presented at the annual ""Earth Science Day"" at UTEP, which generally attracts ~2000 visitors from the general public.<br/><br/>Three agricultural sites and one natural site along the Rio Grande valley, that are typical and representative of aridland settings worldwide, will be examined in the study.

Whitecaps, which are created during wave breaking (stage A) and linger on the surface afterwards (stage B), have considerable influence on the boundary layer and climate. For example, they are critical to the exchange of heat, mass, and momentum, the production of aerosols, upper-ocean mixing, gas diffusion, and tropical storm intensity. Whitecap coverage is used expansively to estimate these and other processes, yet the routinely employed wind speed dependence has orders of magnitude uncertainty that is, in large part, due to large variations in stage B lifetime. In order to understand the factors influencing foam lifetime, a ship-based field study of whitecaps will be conducted with infrared imagery, acoustic characterization of bubble plumes and additional oceanographic and meteorological measurements. The data will be analyzed statistically to yield a model that will predict stage B lifetime in various environments leading to more accurate estimates of whitecap coverage and the surface processes they infer. Whitecaps are used during satellite remote sensing to estimate surface winds and surface albedo both of which are initializing variables in climate models. A more robust knowledge of whitecaps will therefore improve these models. Furthermore, whitecaps must be accounted for when using satellites to retrieve ocean color and primary production estimates. This will also be more accurate as a result of this research. A great deal of anthropogenic CO2 is sequestered into the ocean and exchanged across the air-sea interface, in part, through whitecap air entrainment and bubble bursting. Small droplets produced when whitecap bubbles burst scatter solar radiation and act as cloud condensation nuclei, affecting cloud albedo. Understanding the complex interactions at the air-sea interface that influence whitecaps in the contemporary ocean will enable researchers to construct better informed models of the impact whitecaps have on climate and may be used to predict the role of whitecaps in the future Earth system. Deaf and Hard of Hearing (HoH) students from Texas A&M University will be recruited to work on this project. These high impact learning experiences will provide Deaf and HoH students from other disciplines the opportunity to participate in STEM research which may otherwise not be available. It is expected that this will lead to more Deaf and HoH students earning undergraduate degrees in STEM fields leading to graduate degrees and STEM careers. A graduate student will be supported through this research and receive training in physical oceanography. Science majors from across the Texas A&M University campus will be offered an opportunity for hands-on research experience in oceanography, and several undergraduate students will become active partners in the research by conducting individual research projects. Results from the research will primarily be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at scientific meetings, with students playing an active role at all stages in the dissemination process.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to develop a parametric model that can predict stage B whitecap lifetime. The model will be created using data from shipboard infrared images of whitecaps captured simultaneously with measurements of meteorological and oceanographic conditions at the air-sea interface. Infrared remote sensing will be used because it provides clear, unambiguous separation of whitecap stages not afforded by other remote sensing techniques. These data will be analyzed using a principle component analysis to determine each parameter's relative contribution to the lifetime of stage B whitecaps and to develop the model. Infrared images will be recorded in the Gulf of Mexico during multiple cruises in order to capture a wide variety of conditions that will lend strength to the model. Shipboard data will be supplemented with wave information taken from existing buoy networks. This research is a collaboration between the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in Washington, D.C. and the Department of Oceanography at Texas A&M University. Both institutions bring equipment that the other does not have, leading to collaboration much greater than its parts.

These processes, such as mineral weathering and carbon and nitrogen cycling, directly affect soil health. In order to advance our understanding of these soil processes, this research project will combine continuous, high precision monitoring of soil pore space oxygen, carbon dioxide, and ammonia gas concentrations, each of which are affected by these processes, with the development of a computer model. Undergraduate students who identify with underrepresented groups will be recruited to participate in this research project. The research results will help to quantify soils as a carbon source/sink and inform sustainable land management practices aimed at feeding the expanding global population while managing environmental contamination from fertilizers. These results will be disseminated through courses that the PI teaches, in addition to peer-reviewed publications.<br/><br/>The respiratory quotient (RQ, moles of CO2 produced per mole of O2 consumed during respiration) is a fundamental indicator of metabolism that we currently cannot monitor in-situ in soils. Learning about soil community RQ and the factors that affect its variability will help to understand microbial metabolisms, controls on autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration rates, and ultimately soil carbon cycling. Therefore, the goal of this research project is to isolate continuously and monitor in-situ the RQ of the soil community. The first step of this research project will be to expand existing soil physics and chemistry models to quantify the effects of diffusion and gas-water exchange on soil gas composition. The effectiveness of these adapted models will be tested using controlled laboratory experiments. The next step will be to calibrate pore space NH3 and O2 concentrations as a measure of nitrification, using laboratory incubations of soils selected for later field-monitoring. This information is required for accurate determination of RQ, because nitrification consumes O2 in addition to that consumed by respiration. The final step will be to measure continuously and in-situ CO2, O2, and NH3 concentrations in natural soils using commercially-available flow-through sensors coupled to a custom-built autosampler. Simultaneous measurement of soil moisture, soil temperature, and relevant meteorological variables will accompany the soil gas monitoring. The expanded soil physics model and the laboratory soil core calibrations will be used to account for diffusion, water-gas exchange and nitrification in order to determine soil community RQ. Variation in soil community RQ through time and space in grassland and forest soils will be investigated. An improved understanding of natural variability in soil RQ will advance 1) understanding of soil biotic processes, such as how metabolisms in soil change temporally and spatially, and 2) the interaction between biotic and abiotic processes, such as those that drive chemical weathering and calcium carbonate dissolution/precipitation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Targeted Observation by Radars and UAS of Supercells (TORUS) aims to improve the conceptual model of supercells by explicating the relationship of storm-generated boundaries and coherent structures within storm outflow to the generation/amplification of near-surface rotation. New insight will be enabled through coordinated and tightly-focused deployments of new and established remote-sensing and in-situ instruments tasked to collect thermodynamic and kinematic observations both aloft and at the surface.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>Hypothesized mechanisms for tornadogenesis move beyond a focus on just the canonical rear-flank and forward-flank gust fronts and also address the role of boundaries and coherent structures recently revealed in observational and numerical analyses of supercell tornadoes.

Overarching objectives are to 1) expose the 4D character of these boundaries and coherent structures, 2) relate the 4D character of these boundaries and coherent structures to the thermodynamics and kinematics of supercell outflow, 3) associate boundary and coherent structure characteristics to ensuing contraction or failed contraction of near-surface vertical vorticity beneath low-level mesocyclones, and 4) and relate these characteristics to the ambient conditions within which storms reside. <br/><br/>The TORUS field campaign will be executed across 42 days of deployments spanning two spring seasons (May-June 2019 and 2020) over an operations domain covering ~1,300,000 km2 of the central US.

While the scales are different, the deep geologic past provides test cases against which climate models can be compared or from which they can be created.  However, spatial coverage by paleoclimate proxies is best for middle latitudes, and quite limited for the tropics and subtropics, especially in the terrestrial realm.

The objectives of this project are to:<br/>1. compare Early Miocene and Late Oligocene paleoclimate, paleoecology, and biogeography using multiple independent proxies.<br/>2. provide pCO2 estimates from pedogenic goethite and stomatal indices.<br/>3. provide Early Miocene paleoecological and paleoclimatological context for faunal evolution during an otherwise poorly known, but significant time interval for Africa. <br/>4. address plant biogeographic questions, e.g. a decline in palm richness and importance<br/>5. test methods by (a) comparing &#948;D isotopes from aquatic and terrestrial lipids to test for enrichment of D due to evapotranspiration, (b) comparing goethite and stomatal index pCO2 data (c) evaluating the consistency of paleotemperature and precipitation reconstructions using methods based upon leaf physiognomy, overlapping ranges of plant taxa, qualitative and quantitative paleosol analyses, and multiple isotope geochemical proxies. <br/>Non-technical Description and Broader Significance: This grant funds a multidisciplinary team of scientists who will sample rocks and fossils from the Ethiopian Plateau northeast of Addis Ababa to reconstruct past climate, vegetation, atmospheric CO2 concentration (pCO2), and the physical landscape 22 million years ago in an integrated and collaborative way. Team members, who have collaborated before on rocks from the Plateau that are 27 million years old, have expertise in the study of plant fossil identification, insect damage to fossil leaves, the reconstruction of past climate and ecology, the geochemistry of ancient soils and organic plant compounds, and geology. The locality preserves extraordinary plant fossils having cellular detail, smaller vertebrates including frogs with soft tissue preservation, and large mammal bones.  The scientific significance of our work is that it will resolve currently conflicting data regarding global temperature and pCO2 between 27 million and 22 million years ago.  Marine records show a significant rise in global temperature between these times, but some records of pCO2 show a decline and others a rise.  Resolution of this conflict by acquisition of temperature and pCO2 data from one region using multiple independent sources will tell us if our understanding of CO2, in relation to global temperature is correct.  Furthermore, the modern land connection between Africa and Eurasia was established about 24 million years ago, so we will be able to compare the younger plant and animal fossils with those from a time prior to contact with Eurasia.  Africa?s flora and fauna was in a period of transition at this time, and its documentation is important for understanding the origins of modern biomes. <br/>Educational outreach includes distance learning for thousands of K-12 students.  This team has a history of blogs, currently hosted by the SMU Public Affairs office on the main website, and recently through the NY Times Scientist at Work pages. Students will be an integral part of this project ? this team has regularly taken students into the field and will continue to do so.

Landslides occur globally, can cause tsunamis, and pose threats to people and infrastructure, especially near coasts. To reduce this impact on people and infrastructure, it is critical to advance our understanding of slope stability in ocean sediments. This project focuses on continental margins where earthquakes typically do not occur, and as such, do not act as triggers for landslides. In these sites, it remains unclear how the skeletal remains of microorganisms that live in the ocean and end up in ocean sediments could potentially weaken and precondition those sediments for failure and underwater landslides. The goal of the education activities is to provide high impact learning experiences and research opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. This project is geared towards students from underrepresented groups in a STEM field, namely geosciences, in Texas, which lacks Earth science curriculum requirements. This will be achieved through an annually recurring education program with the local Bryan High School consisting of classroom visits, a one-day workshop, and two-week summer research activity. An undergraduate and graduate student course will be developed, which includes a domestic field trip to West Texas and New Mexico to study submarine slope channels and landslide deposits. Through all components, this project will foster next-generation researchers who can facilitate interdisciplinary science and broad collaboration to advance knowledge and mitigate natural hazards.<br/><br/>This research project integrates experimental and numerical efforts and aims to characterize the role of microfossils in generating weak layers, which could become large-scale glide planes for submarine landslides. In this project, marine sediments will be systematically mixed with diatomite in varying concentrations and under repeatable conditions. The research goals are to determine key microfossil concentrations with threshold behavior, exact location within the sediment package, and burial conditions under which overpressure may be induced and wide-spread failure initiated within or above a microfossil-rich weak layer. Therefore, this proposed research will not only provide insights into slope failure mechanisms for microfossil-rich sediments but will also help in identifying potential future glide planes from cores and/or logging data from submarine and lacustrine settings where landslides may occur without external triggers like earthquakes. To document mechanical, hydraulic, and shear properties of microfossil-rich marine sediments, uniaxial resedimentation and constant rate of strain consolidation, as well as direct shear and triaxial shear experiments will be conducted at effective stresses corresponding to common landslide initiation depths. Microstructural changes, microfossil deformation, and development of shear failure planes will be qualitatively and quantitatively characterized by integrating analysis of hydromechanical data from deformation experiments with microscale imaging observations. Numerical slope stability models will provide insights into upscaling measured properties and introducing heterogeneous layered systems that analyze the interaction between microfossil-rich weak layers with over-and underlying non-biogenic sediments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hence understanding the origin of continents and how portions of them remain stable for billions of years is central to understanding the evolution of the Earth. The old, stable cores of continents (cratons) are underlain by thick layers of mantle (the silicate layer of the Earth that lies below the crust), and these mantle roots are thought to contribute to continental stability. Yet, it remains debated how the continental mantle formed and evolved. In particular, the roles of magma or fluid interaction with the mantle, either during or after the continent formation, are unclear, although widespread layering observed in the cratonic mantle by seismic imaging may have been created by magma and fluid related processes. This research will constrain the formation and evolution of cratons by bracketing scenarios of melt/fluid and mantle reactions that are consistent with geophysical observations at mid-lithospheric depths. The research findings - disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and colloquia, and class room lectures and activities - will impact a wide range of Earth science sub-disciplines including petrology-geochemistry, mineral physics, geodynamics, and seismology. The proposal will support female PhD students in high P-T experimental petrology, mineral physics, and seismology, and support the research activities of several undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups. In addition to their own research, all the students will participate in discussions and write research articles together with all 3 PIs, learning how to combine concepts and methods from three different yet related sub-disciplines of solid Earth science. The proposal will thus directly further the educational experience and professional development of several students at various stages of their careers. The proposed research will also support an early career PI in the field of mineral physics and will aid the investigators in engaging K-12 students in science.<br/><br/>The stability of the continental interiors for 2-3 billion years is a key feature of the Earth's dynamical and thermal evolution. Understanding the geophysical structure, petrology, and material properties of cratonic mantles and the tectonic history that produced them is therefore one of the grand challenges of Earth science. A curious feature of subcontinental mantles is the presence of distinct reductions in seismic shear velocity at depths of 60-150 km, often called mid-lithospheric discontinuities (MLDs). Given the widespread occurrence of MLDs within cratons, their origins may be linked to craton formation; however, the causal link between MLD and craton formation is yet to be established, and MLD origins remain highly debated. One hypothesis is that MLDs represent zones enriched in CO2-H2O volatiles, which led to stability of hydrous and/or carbonate minerals or partial melts. This project will test this hypothesis by integrating results from experimental petrology, mineral physics, and seismology. Through laboratory experiments, this project will constrain the phase equilibria of cratonic mantle peridotites fluxed by mixed CO2-H2O volatiles at MLD depths, taking into consideration how the agent of volatile introduction may vary with craton formation models. The goal will be to determine the stability of hydrous and carbonate mineral phases over partial melts and obtain the compositions and proportions of mineral phases as a function of depth, temperature, and melt/fluid:peridotite ratio for each of the cases. Guided by the phase equilibria experiments and compiled xenolith data, thermoelastic properties of the appropriate end members and intermediate solid solutions of amphibole and mica will be determined using Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS) and first principles simulation. Using the mineral assemblages from experiments and updated elasticity data from new mineral physics, mantle velocity models will be predicted. These will be compared to mantle models for southern African craton (to be obtained by joint inversion of surface wave, Sp and Ps data) and North America, and used to calculate synthetic Sp and Ps receiver function stacks that will be compared to MLD observations globally. The proposed research will test whether one or several scenarios of fluid/melt infiltration into cratons, if any, satisfy the geophysical and petrologic characters of continental mantles at mid-lithospheric depths. Our research will also lead to specific products such as solidus parameterizations of depleted mantle+CO2+H2O; metasomatized mantle mineral assemblages as a function of P-T, infiltrated fluid/melt composition and fluid/melt:rock ratio; codes for computing seismic velocities for MLD-related assemblages with updated thermoelastic data; and observed mantle discontinuity parameters and mantle velocity models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, significant uncertainty in projections of future hurricane risk exist because the climatic drivers of changes in hurricane activity is poorly known. This is exacerbated by the exceedingly short instrumental record of hurricane occurrence in the western Atlantic, which makes diagnosing the climatic controls on hurricane activity difficult. This project utilizes historical and long-term geological reconstructions of hurricane activity in the western North Atlantic, which extends our knowledge of hurricane occurrence back centuries and even millennia. This approach allows assessment of how the risk posed by hurricanes along the east coast of the United States has changed. Further, the researchers will use state of the art numerical models to both diagnose the key climatic conditions that contribute to changes in hurricane activity and to provide improved projections of future hurricane risk. Many of the lessons learned from this work will be used by the broader scientific community and planners and decision-makers to improve our preparedness and resilience to possible future changes in hurricane risk.  The results will inform risk modeling, which in turn informs the insurance and re-insurance industries, as well as efforts to mitigate tropical cyclone hazards at the city, state and federal levels. Finally, the project will provide the opportunity to train and educate the next generation of scientists with the engagement of graduate, undergraduate and high school students.<br/><br/>This study takes an integrated research approach that addresses two broad questions: 1) How is the risk of floods changing due to (a) storm surge and (b) rainfall? 2) How do processes like changes in ocean circulations (e.g., Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation) and the response to low latitude volcanic eruptions modulate hurricane activity, both generally and specifically for US landfalling storms? Reconstruction of past changes in hurricane landfalls along the Northeast US, Florida east coast, and northwestern Gulf of Mexico will be coupled with hydrodynamic modeling of tropical cyclone related storm surges and waves and downscaled estimates of TC-related rainfall. This approach will allow determination of changes in risk of TC-induced flooding over the last millennium. This will form the baseline for examining future risk and for examining critical forcing mechanisms that may significantly alter future regional landfall probabilities. Downscaling the latest (CMIP6) global model output coupled with hydrodynamic modeling of surge and waves will be used to assess current and future risk of TC-induced flooding. In addition, we will explore the potential influence of volcanic aerosols that penetrate the stratosphere on TC activity. Further, this study plans to examine the influence of changes in ocean circulation on TCs, which affects the probability of intense hurricane landfalls by altering the amount of ocean heat content available to TCs close to landfall.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Preliminary data indicate an active subsurface biosphere in samples of the lower oceanic crust collected from Atlantis Bank in the SW Indian Ocean as deep as 790 m below the seafloor. Even if life exists in only a fraction of the habitable volume where temperatures permit and fluid flow can deliver carbon and energy sources, an active lower oceanic crust biosphere would have implications for deep carbon budgets and yield insights into microbiota that may have existed on early Earth. This is all of great interest to other research disciplines, educators, and students alike. A K-12 education program will capitalize on groundwork laid by outreach collaborator, A. Martinez, a 7th grade teacher in Eagle Pass, TX, who sailed as outreach expert on Drilling Expedition 360. Martinez works at a Title 1 school with ~98% Hispanic and ~2% Native American students and a high number of English Language Learners and migrants. Annual school visits occur during which the project investigators present hands on-activities introducing students to microbiology, and talks on marine microbiology, the project, and how to pursue science related careers. In addition, monthly Skype meetings with students and PIs update them on project progress. Students travel to the University of Texas Marine Science Institute annually, where they get a campus tour and a 3-hour cruise on the R/V Katy, during which they learn about and help with different oceanographic sampling approaches. The project partially supports two graduate students, a Woods Hole undergraduate summer student, the participation of multiple Texas A+M undergraduate students, and 3 principal investigators at two institutions, including one early career researcher who has not previously received NSF support of his own. <br/><br/>Given the dearth of knowledge of the lower oceanic crust, this project is poised to transform our understanding of life in this vast environment. The project assesses metabolic functions within all three domains of life in this crustal biosphere, with a focus on nutrient cycling and evaluation of connections to other deep marine microbial habitats. The lower ocean crust represents a potentially vast biosphere whose microbial constituents and the biogeochemical cycles they mediate are likely linked to deep ocean processes through faulting and subsurface fluid flow. Atlantis Bank represents a tectonic window that exposes lower oceanic crust directly at the seafloor. This enables seafloor drilling and research on an environment that can transform our understanding of connections between the deep subseafloor biosphere and the rest of the ocean. Preliminary analysis of recovered rocks from Expedition 360 suggests the interaction of seawater with the lower oceanic crust creates varied geochemical conditions capable of supporting diverse microbial life by providing nutrients and chemical energy.  This project is the first interdisciplinary investigation of the microbiology of all 3 domains of life in basement samples that combines diversity and ""meta-omics"" analyses, analysis of nutrient addition experiments, high-throughput culturing and physiological analyses of isolates, including evaluation of their ability to utilize specific carbon sources, Raman spectroscopy, and lipid biomarker analyses. Comparative genomics are used to compare genes and pathways relevant to carbon cycling in these samples to data from published studies of other deep-sea environments. The collected samples present a rare and time-sensitive opportunity to gain detailed insights into microbial life, available carbon and energy sources for this life, and of dispersal of microbiota and connections in biogeochemical processes between the lower oceanic crust and the overlying aphotic water column."

Furthermore, seismic waves can also induce liquefaction and volcanic eruptions. However, the physics of these triggered phenomena are unknown. This work will focus on understanding the physical conditions that can trigger earthquakes, either by passing seismic waves or by human activity, such as fluid injection at wells. Specifically, this study will investigate a pressure surge phenomenon, which could be the common underlying mechanism for all these triggered phenomena although in different geological settings. The investigator will use both numerical modeling and physical experiments to discriminate between competing physical mechanisms that lead to earthquake triggering. Elucidating the triggering mechanism has broad and fundamental societal impact in the mitigation of natural hazards. This work will support an early career faculty member and a graduate student. <br/><br/>The passing of weak seismic waves not only can suddenly trigger earthquakes but can also change the fluid permeability of a hydrologic system, cause liquefaction and bring on volcanic eruptions. However, what mechanisms control all these different triggered occurrences are largely unknown because the stress perturbation due to the seismic wave is extremely small and it is on the order of a few thousand Pascal, equivalent to the weight of a few coins. Finding the underlying triggering mechanism has been a central problem in Geophysics. This 2-year study seeks to make a fundamental breakthrough in understanding these triggered phenomena. The investigator recently identified a dynamic pressure surge phenomenon where the fluid pressure in a fluid-filled fracture can increase 2-3 orders of magnitude relative to the incident wave pressure. The increase in fluid pressure can reduce the effective confining pressure to trigger earthquakes or to produce a pressure gradient to drive fluid flow. This newly discovered effect could be much more pronounced for a low-frequency incidence seismic wave than that for a high-frequency one, which agrees with observations. In addition to its frequency-dependence, the pressure surge phenomenon also depends on the fracture geometry and aperture. This project will investigate a scientifically testable hypothesis, which can fill the knowledge gap in understanding triggering of many phenomena, including earthquake dynamic triggering. To test this hypothesis, the investigator will use both high-performance computing on numerical models and laboratory experiments. The proposed idea and approaches are promising and may have far-reaching consequences in not only the earthquake but also the volcano hazards mitigation. In addition, the insights learned from this project can be used to create new subsurface sensing and imaging methods, useful in carbon sequestration, nuclear waste disposal, and unconventional/geothermal energy development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rather than the expected smooth response to the Moon's shadow, the electron and ion temperatures observed by two satellites traversing the topside ionosphere at 850 km in altitude showed complex and sporadic jumps between regions of cooler plasma and regions where the temperatures were nominal. This project will investigate these unexpected plasma temperature modulations by conducting a thorough analysis of the plasma observations (temperatures, density, flows) for this and other past eclipse events. This will provide important information about how the ionosphere responds to the transient changes in the illumination drivers. Knowledge of these responses is important since solar illumination is a key driver of fundamental processes of ionization and structuring. Radio propagation through the ionosphere depends on how much ionization and structuring occurs, and solar eclipses provide a controlled and quantifiable way to learn more about both positive and adverse effects of the ionosphere on global networks that use radio frequencies, for example the Global Navigation Satellite System. <br/><br/>This project will provide detailed characterization of the ionospheric plasma anomalies during solar eclipses using Defense Meteorological Satellite Program measurements of the plasma density, electron and ion temperatures, and plasma transport. It will also provide identification and characterization of mutual relationship between the irregular solar source regions and consequential ionospheric transient modulation. Finally, the project will identify the physical mechanisms, controlling parameters, and limiting cases of the anomalous flows and temperatures. The ultimate goal of this work is to obtain a better understanding of how short-term changes in the illumination of the dayside ionosphere can produce non-uniform responses in the ionospheric density, temperature, and drifts.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to the development of a highly-skilled workforce by supporting a graduate student at Boston University.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The variation of this field on the very longest wavelengths describes the elliptical shape of the Earth. This elliptical figure is important because it determines the location of the axis of rotation that passes through the Earth's center and also controls changes in inclination of the Earth relative to the sun, owing to the gravitational 'pull' from the moon, the sun, and other planets. The Earth, in effect, behaves as a spinning top that can oscillate and wobble in complex ways. These changes in axial rotation and inclination affect how much solar energy ('insolation') is received at different latitudes on Earth, especially in the polar regions, and therefore has a major impact on climate and how it changes over long time intervals. A major problem in geophysics is to determine how the elliptical form of the Earth is generated by forces deep inside our planet. These forces also drive the horizontal motions of Earth's tectonic plates and the geological 'drift' of continents, as well as vertically pushing and pulling the continents and oceans up and down over time. Despite more than thirty years of progress by geophysicists who map lateral changes in Earth structure deep inside our planet using seismic waves, and similar progress by computational geophysicists who use these maps to model the internal forces needed to explain the motions of tectonic plates and the 'bumps' in Earth's gravity field, there remains a difficulty in properly accounting for the flattening of the elliptical figure of the Earth that is seen by satellites. The principal investigators (PIs) in this proposal will directly tackle this outstanding challenge by using both earthquake and gravity data, and data describing the topography of the Earth and the movements of tectonic plates, to obtain new maps of Earth's internal structure and new determinations of the forces that can explain all these data simultaneously. The outcome of this work will allow the PIs to specifically tackle the current challenge of accounting for Earth's long-term elliptical figure, how it changes with time, and how it influences high-latitude insolation and hence climate over long times. Powerful computer resources will be deployed to carry out this study over the next three years, employing a collaborative team of researchers from the Universities of Texas and Florida. This work will provide opportunities for training new graduate students who will learn state-of-the-art techniques in computer modelling and will develop advanced expertise in the geophysical sciences. The results of this work will be shared with a broad community of scientists, students and the general public with web-based platforms, communications in conferences and workshop, and in outreach activities.<br/><br/>Key questions regarding the large-scale structure and dynamics of the mantle remain outstanding, despite three decades of progress in global seismic imaging of Earth's interior. There are longstanding difficulties in satisfactorily accounting for the very longest wavelength anomalies in Earth's gravity field, which are related to Earth's elliptical figure, with significant implications for Earth's time-dependent rotational dynamics. Questions concerning heterogeneity in the transition zone and the nature of ""large low shear velocity provinces"" (LLSVP) in the lower mantle, also continue to be elusive. These uncertainties regarding anomalous mantle structures directly impact our understanding of the global-scale dynamics of the Earth. To address the questions, the principal investigators propose a multidisciplinary effort to derive a new generation of tomography models that match a wide suite of surface data related to present-day structure and convective flow in the mantle, and can also constrain the time-dependent evolution of the mantle throughout the Cenozoic. To pursue these objectives the PIs will: (i) jointly invert global seismic and convection-related data with greatly improved coverage of 3-D mantle structure, incorporating geodynamic responses to lateral viscosity variations and topography on the discontinuities at the top and bottom of the transition zone; (ii) apply data assimilation methods to the new joint tomography models to reconstruct the Cenozoic evolution of 3-D mantle structure; (iii) calculate corresponding changes of Earth's moment of inertia, to be used in reconstructions of true polar wander and Milankovitch orbital cycles that are implicated in long-term climate variations. It is anticipated these new joint tomography models will provide improved constraints on the impact of transition-zone heterogeneity on convective mass and heat transport across this key region and on the spatial distribution of anomalous density structures within the LLSVP. This work will also contribute to resolving a longstanding difficulty concerning the origin of Earth's anomalous elliptical figure and the implications for the phase and amplitude of Milankovitch climate cycles in the geological past.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A better understanding of the 2011 M9 Tohoku (Japan) earthquake is critical for us to do a better job in forecasting future megathrust earthquakes worldwide. This project aims to address two categories of questions about the earthquake. First, why did the 2011 event happen in the way it did? What physical conditions on the subducting fault control features in rupture propagation and slip distribution inferred from seismic/geodetic data? Second, what is the relationship between the 2011 event and previous large events of M7~8 on the subducting fault? What control generation of large earthquakes of different sizes along the subduction zone? We hypothesize that geometrical complexities on the subducting plane, including bends/kinks of the subducting plane and subducted seafloor features such as seamounts, play the primary role in controlling the 2011 event and megathrust events of different sizes along this subduction zone. We propose to use computer models with constraints from observations to address these questions. We will use a dynamic finite element method code to perform dynamic rupture modeling of the co-seismic process of the 2011 event to address the first category of questions. For the second category, we will use the code to perform earthquake cycle simulations at the subduction zone, with the dynamic relaxation technique to obtain solutions for the quasi-static processes between two adjacent earthquakes by the dynamic solver. <br/><br/>What we learn from the 2011 M9 event and the subduction zone in this project can be applied broadly to subduction zones worldwide, including the Cascadia subduction zone along the west coast of the North America continent, to mitigate hazards from future megathrust earthquakes and tsunamis. Addressing the two categories of questions from a physical point of view as we propose is extremely important in advancing our understanding of generation of megathrust earthquakes, and thus in forecasting future megathrust earthquakes along subduction zones. The procedure for earthquake cycle simulations along subduction zones may serve as a powerful tool to assimilate large datasets and to address difficult questions in earthquake science. Course modules on earthquake generation processes and complexities to be developed will bring cutting-edge research results into classrooms of colleges and high schools across the nation. Installation and operation of a seismometer and setup of physical models of spring-slider systems at Texas A&M University will provide hands-on resources for teaching and outreach activities at various levels, and promote awareness of earthquake hazards and understanding of earthquake phenomena."
