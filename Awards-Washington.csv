In particular, high spatial and temporal resolution (meter scale, daily frequency) observations of snow-covered areas in mountain regions are critical as snow is important for water resources, driving the seasonal hydrological regimes of the Western U.S., with significant impacts on ecological communities. Planet Labs, Inc. (Planet) is a promising new source of commercial Cubesat high-resolution imagery that can be used in environmental science, as it has both high spatial (3.0-4.0 m) and temporal (1-2 day) resolution. This project will develop open-source, cloud-based cyberinfrastructure including an automated pipeline for processing, analyzing and interpreting Planet Cubesat image data using a machine learning approach to infer snow cover at meter-scale resolution. All models and data products will be openly available for use and modification by scientific communities. The project will support the training of students, postdocs and other early-career researchers through training events, special interest groups, and incubator programs. <br/><br/>Currently, remotely-sensed snow observations with adequate temporal (daily) resolution are either captured at a spatial scale far too large to be relevant to high-resolution hydrology and ecology studies (e.g. MODIS, 500m) or are appropriate in spatial scale (1-10 m) but have inadequate temporal resolution and are cost-prohibitive (e.g. airborne LiDAR). The recent increase of commercial Earth Observation data with high spatiotemporal resolution may bridge the gap between ground-based and low-resolution satellite observation data. This project will focus on using convolutional neural networks-based models to couple ground and airborne-derived snow observations with Planet imagery in three different montane systems in Washington, California, and Colorado. These sites have very good coverage of ground and airborne snow observations at high resolution (3m) collected by the NASA Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) and SnowEx missions, which will be used in the training and validation of the models. The project will develop advanced cyberinfrastructure using scalable virtual machines, distributed collaborative architecture, reusable computational frameworks, and replicable machine learning workflows to empower Earth scientists to access, process and generate high-resolution snow products from Cubesat data. The project will adopt open-source strategies and ensure that all data, algorithms, and architecture comply with FAIR data principles and reproducibility and will include training materials that promote the adoption of the infrastructure and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The recent surge in the deployment of autonomous echosounders has resulted in a deluge of echo data from a variety of ocean observing platforms, including vehicles and moorings. These data sets harbor great potential for advancing our understanding of marine ecosystems at spatial and temporal scales never before possible. However, the volume and complexity of the data make efficient and effective analysis a major challenge. This research is aimed at establishing a data-driven methodology to automatically extract features from echosounder data, thus unblocking this bottleneck between instrumentation capacity (to collect large data) and interpretation capability (to analyze large data). The developed method will expedite the currently labor-intensive data analysis process and help extract synoptic information from large echo data sets. Results of this research will be disseminated through open-source echo analysis software packages and online educational materials created as integrated components of this project. This research contributes directly to improving our ability to better understand the marine ecosystems, which are critical for global biodiversity and the economic well-being of a significant population of society.<br/><br/>This research will develop a method for automated discovery and tracking of low-dimensional spatio-temporal structures from high-dimensional echo data by adapting a state-of-the-art dynamic non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) formulation. NMF is an unsupervised machine learning technique that decomposes complex data into a linear combination of a smaller set of quantitative descriptors that are more tractable and interpretable than the original data. This technique has found great success in many basic research and applied fields, including computer vision, neuroscience, natural language processing, and recommender systems for internet retailers. In the context of echo analysis, these low-dimensional descriptors characterize the vertical movements and grouping activities of marine organisms in the water column imaged by the echosounder. However, traditional NMF does not account well for a changing set of phenomena in the data. Therefore, this project aims to develop a method that can provide a temporally adaptive decomposition in order to accommodate the complexity and high temporal variability of transient features in long-term echosounder data. The researchers will use data collected by the two cabled Endurance Array echosounders in NSF?s Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) as a test bed for methodology development. The stability, robustness, and interpretability of the developed method will be evaluated and compared with conventional echo analysis routines. This effort will lay the foundation for further machine learning and statistical studies of large echo datasets from the OOI and other ocean observing systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance a 1995 heat wave resulted in over 600 deaths in Chicago, and the European heat wave of 2003 claimed more than 50,000 lives.  Heat waves also cause indirect harm by contributing to crop failures, wildfires, droughts, and poor air quality.  Heat wave frequency has increased dramatically over the past decades, accompanying the rise of global mean temperature, and further increases are expected as temperature continues to rise.  Warmer temperatures also lead to more ""concurrent heat waves"", meaning simultaneous heat waves that cover a substantial fraction of the summer hemisphere land surface.<br/><br/>Weather patterns leading to heat waves are easy to identify, commonly involving stagnant high-pressure systems accompanied by clear skies and subsiding air. But more perceptive analysis is required to understand why those weather patterns form, how long they remain in place, and the extent to which maximum temperatures within them are affected by the dryness of the surface or other local effects.  A further consideration is that heat waves are typically identified as prolonged periods of extremely hot weather, but high humidity can matter as much as high temperature for human health effects.  Compared to traditional heat waves the meteorology of humid heat waves is relatively unexplored.<br/><br/>Research conducted here considers the contributions of dynamic and thermodynamic processes to heat waves considering both dry and humid events.  A key consideration is the extent to which heat waves are prolonged and intensified by dry soil, which prevents evaporative cooling of the land surface. Another is the extent to which distinct physical mechanisms lead to dry and humid events, where humid events are defined as extremes of the wet bulb temperature (WBT). WBT is the lowest temperature that can be achieved through evaporative cooling given ambient temperature and moisture.  It is a good indicator of human heat stress as we rely on evaporation of perspiration to avoid heat stress at high temperatures.<br/><br/>One analysis tool is causal effect networks (CENs), a graphical technique borrowed from information theory and machine learning in which causality is established through lagged regression.  Preliminary work using CENs suggests that an early summer heat wave can lead to reduced precipitation, which dries the soil and promotes additional heat waves. The work is performed using a combination of observations and output from climate model simulations of present-day and projected future climate, and model simulations are devised to further test and examine physical mechanisms.<br/><br/>The work is of practical as well as scientific interest given the severe consequences of heat waves as noted above.  Outreach to stakeholders concerned with heat wave impacts is performed through the Consortium for Climate Risk in the Urban Northeast (CCRUN), where one of the researchers has a leadership role.  Interactions with students interested in climate impacts is enabled through the lead researcher's role as Director of the Masters degree granting Climate and Society program at Columbia University. The project also involves a Primarily Undergraduate Institution (PUI), and results are incorporated into undergraduate classroom teaching.  In addition, two graduate students are supported through this award.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research program seeks to understand how these flows affect larger circulation patterns, particularly the meridional and zonal flow components of global circulation.  The meridional flow is involved critically in the process that leads to Sun's polar field polarity reversals and the ability to predict properties of subsequent solar cycles.  It is not clear how it is modulated in time by the contribution of active-region related inflows.  A quantitative assessment of this contribution, provided by this research project, will allow critical improvements to be made in predictive models.  Theories regarding the physics of the flows have been put forward, with predictions about their variation with depth.  These predictions will be tested by the inverse modeling efforts as part of this project.  Using artificial data available from numerical MHD simulations, the research activities will also aim to develop and validate methods to infer subsurface flows reliably and which avoid artifacts caused by the influence of surface magnetic fields on the seismic waves.  These methods will be invaluable for improving and validating other models of flows and structures inferred through helioseismology.<br/><br/>The main purpose of this 3-year project is to perform a comprehensive, high-spatial-resolution helioseismic survey of subsurface flows around solar magnetic regions in order to improve models of solar dynamo.  The research project has four main objectives. The first objective is to characterize, using helioseismic holography applied to Dopplergrams from the Helioseismic Imager onboard the SDO mission, the near-surface flows observed around solar active regions.  This characterization will include examining the dependence of the flow properties with magnetic flux.  The time dependence of the flows as regions evolve will also be examined.  The second objective is to establish and quantify the contribution of the near-surface flows surrounding active regions to the latitudinal- and temporal-variation of the global meridional and zonal flow patterns.  This will be achieved by comparing monthly time and longitude averages of active-region related flows with meridional and zonal flow measurements.  The third objective is to determine, through helioseismic inverse modeling, the depth dependence of active-region related flows, in order to provide a physical understanding of the flows.  The fourth objective is to validate the reliability of the flow determination around active regions.  This will be achieved using existing synthetic data derived from state-of-the-art numerical MHD simulations of waves in the vicinity of magnetic structures.<br/><br/>An understanding of the contribution of active-region-related flows in Sun's interior to the larger-scale dynamics is required for improving surface-flux-transport models of the solar dynamo.  The outcome of this project is expected to improve general knowledge of solar and stellar dynamos and the evolution of magnetic fields.  The expected results will allow improvements in predicting the solar-cycles of the Sun.  The project team will broadly disseminate data products for their use in these types of models as part of this program.  This project will facilitate continued involvement of the team in the REU Program in Solar and Space Physics hosted by the University of Colorado at Boulder.  A considerable portion of this research is being carried out by a postdoctoral research scientist who will take the lead on several of the project tasks.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research."

In a CGI-structured course, the instructor guides the students in scientific inquiry using computational tools for managing, analyzing, and visualizing data. This project will create a set of seven CGI modules (e,g, Jupyter notebooks, Excel spreadsheets) that will incorporate polar research and data into a variety of undergraduate classes. The aim is to improve student climate literacy and to increase student ability to use real data to conduct scientific inquiry while at the same time enhancing learning outcomes for course objectives.  Instructors will be trained in deploying the CGI modules in an active learning framework in a summer workshop and will then implement the modules in a variety of undergraduate classes (atmosphere science, chemistry, physics, environmental economics, and computer science).

Use of real-world datasets is believed to authentically engage students in questions that are relevant to them. The CGI modules represent a novel curricular tool, which has the potential to foster cross-disciplinary learning: students learn course topics while also learning about polar data, how to use real data in inquiry, and computer programming. The proposed work is a first step in testing and evaluating the potential of these CGI modules to enhance student learning.<br/><br/>The proposed work represents a range of broader impacts, including education of undergraduate students, development of course materials, advancement of active learning methods and undergraduate student participation in research. This work will benefit society through increasing climate literacy, understanding of the Polar Regions and their role in the climate, and computational literacy at the undergraduate level. Furthermore, the skills acquired by students engaging in the active learning activities proposed here are expected to be useful in contexts beyond the classroom. These include collaboration, critical thinking, data analysis, and problem solving skills, which are vital in helping students learn to think scientifically about engineering solutions to complex challenges; these skills are believed to be as critical to successful STEM education as the content itself. Student engagement in inquiry with real data and bona fide research tools will help change their self-perceptions from passive learners to realized scientists. The educational materials developed as part of this proposal will directly impact a variety of undergraduate courses through the engagement of instructors from a range of institutions, including state universities, liberal arts colleges, and community colleges. This project has the potential of reaching an estimated 1000 undergraduate students during the grant period. To achieve wider dissemination, and to continue to reach undergraduate students after the grant period ends, all materials will be shared in an online educational portal."

The EarthScope Alaska Native Geoscience Learning Experience (EarthScope ANGLE) aims to increase Alaskan resilience to geohazards through education and building of an action oriented statewide learning community that connects formal and informal educators, emergency management personnel, scientists, students, community elders and other organizations in rural villages. The great earthquakes and tsunamis that devastated Sumatra on December 26, 2004, Chile on February 27, 2010 and Japan on March 11, 2011 have heightened public concern about similar geologic hazards in our own country. As part of a nationwide effort to study earthquakes and the Earth's crust, the NSF EarthScope Program has been deploying hundreds of seismic, GPS, and other geophysical instruments across the United States. Recently deployed in Alaska, these instruments provide detail for ongoing research showing that coastal regions are storing energy that will be released in great earthquakes, with resulting tsunamis that may impact the entire west coast of the US and Hawaii. Thousands of Alaskan residents live within severe earthquake-shaking and tsunami-inundation zones, and millions of tourists visit state and federal parks in these same areas each year. Teachers in the K-12 school systems convey some basics about geological hazards to their students, and park rangers and museum educators likewise engage visitors at their sites. Both of these groups also at times work with emergency managers. ANGLE is strengthening these efforts by providing community-based workshops that bring together all of these professionals to review the basic science of earthquakes and tsunamis, learn about EarthScope and other research efforts that monitor the dynamic Earth in the region, and develop ways to collectively engage students and the general public on the mitigation of coastal geologic hazards.<br/><br/>The ANGLE project is a collaborative effort among geoscience educators from Alaska Pacific University and Central Washington University with the Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program (ANSEP) at the University of Alaska Anchorage. From 2017-2020, four Educator Professional Development workshops and eight ANSEP academies for Alaska Native students will be conducted. Through these workshops and academies, ANGLE establishes a statewide network of stakeholders that includes students, teachers and Native Elders from rural Alaska Native villages, some of Alaska's most vulnerable communities. The emphasis on educators and Native students will ensure that a wide variety of learners will be reached, either directly or by later contact with ANGLE participants. A synthesis of existing EarthScope educational materials and methods, translated to an Alaskan setting, will form the core of the programming. Drawing from methods of previous EarthScope education projects, ANGLE will incorporate best practices including societal relevance of science, data collection and analysis, nature of science, learning community development, current science standards, and place-based and cultural knowledge. Participating educators will learn about ongoing research on Alaskan tectonics, earthquakes and tsunamis, and about how EarthScope is advancing frontiers of knowledge about geologic hazards in the region. Emergency management outreach leaders will contribute to discussions on emergency preparedness actions. Master teachers offer pedagogical guidance and ideas about assessment and interaction, while experienced interpreters discuss how to reach a variety of audiences in settings outside the classroom. In follow-up share-a-thons, the teachers and interpreters showcase how they have crafted their new knowledge into Earth science and emergency preparedness learning experiences for K-12 students and visitors to parks and museums. Ultimately thousands of learners in various settings will be reached. The final ANGLE-synthesized collection of EarthScope resources will be hosted on the well-known Science Education Resource Center website (>5 million visitors/year) and reviewed by the National Association of Geoscience Teachers insuring high profile access to the resources for years to come."

However, conventional ocean sciences education focuses predominantly on domain-specific knowledge and often falls short in explicitly incorporating these operational skills into the curriculum. The PIs will plan and host several workshops, a virtual workshop in 2020 and two in-person workshops in 2021, that aim to address this urgent need by combining immersive tutorials on state-of-the-art data science methodologies, peer-learning, and on-site collaborative hack project work in a 5-day intensive workshop. This is a domain-specific adaptation of the ?hackweek? model, which has emerged in the computational data science community as a powerful model for educating new users, sharing technical expertise, and building an inclusive and cohesive community. The focus of the workshops is the use of ocean data, and specifically the use of data from the NSF-funded Ocean Observatories Initiative. <br/><br/>The workshops, called ""OceanHackWeek2020-2021"", provide an avenue for expediting the adoption of data science methodologies and computational tools for data-intensive research in the ocean sciences community. These skills are indispensable for modern-day oceanographers to tackle complex scientific questions by harnessing the data revolution. OceanHackWeek differs from traditional academic conferences and one-off hackathons by its immersive curriculum, collaborative learning environment, and a set of carefully crafted participant selection criteria that helps promote diversity and inclusivity. These designs help spur collaborative interdisciplinary ideas and help promote best data science practices in ocean sciences. OceanHackWeek focuses not only on promoting data science literacy but also on building an inclusive and cohesive community of oceanographers for learning and sharing. The organizers encourage and empower participants to bring the skills gained and the sense of community formed during the hackweek back to their own labs and institutions. Beyond the intensive in-person workshop, OceanHackWeek tutorials will be maintained as persistent open online resources to allow anyone to partake and self-learn. By facilitating and catalyzing the growth and change of individuals through grassroot efforts that promote and embrace a diverse community, OceanHackWeek drives cultural change in the field of oceanography.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ASPIRE collaborators will organize Mobile Working Groups (MWG) that will be led by an academic geoscientist who works with a local community on issues that require an expertise in the geosciences. These MWG leaders are referred to as ""gate-openers"". Each MWG will focus on a single issue linked to a single community, but ASPIRE will support multiple MWGs working across a variety of issues and geoscience topics. <br/><br/>During the pilot period, ASPIRE will: 1) learn from the experiences and qualities of geoscientists who already possess experience leading community-relevant research, 2) support them ""individually and collectively"" as leaders of MWGs over a period of one year, 3) identify from their prior and current experiences the sort of leadership required to bridge underserved and geoscience communities, and 4) define and refine the leadership, networking, and logistical support needs that a fully implemented ""bricks and mortar"" center would require. Over the course of the pilot project, ASPIRE will conservatively involve up to forty individuals from across a variety of geoscience institutions, with an additional thirty or more participants, support staff and evaluators. The PIs hypothesize that in institutionalizing a new mode of geoscience research (MWG), learning from the leaders' experiences with MWG, and refining a leadership development program based on findings, they will have a scalable leadership tool and organizational structure that will rebrand the geosciences as socially relevant and inclusive of geoscientists from diverse backgrounds."

These fundamental processes depend on the transport of babies (larvae) by the ocean currents, yet because the larvae are microscopic and diluted in the vastness of the ocean, it is very difficult to determine where and how they drift.  This project uses an autonomous underwater vehicle to collect larvae from precise regions of the water column.  Larval traps on the bottom and chemical analyses of larval shells will also be used to determine the depths where larvae swim.  These findings will provide realistic estimates for mathematical models that show how biology interacts with ocean currents to predict which methane seeps will be colonized by larvae originating at different depths.  A detailed knowledge of larval dispersal is needed for conservation and management of the deep sea. Without such information, we cannot know the best placement of marine protected areas, nor can we facilitate the reestablishment of communities impacted by deep-sea mining, drilling, or other human activities.  This project will provide hands-on at-sea training for college students to learn the rapidly vanishing skills needed for studies of larvae and embryos in their natural habitats.  Learning opportunities will also be available to individuals of all ages through new, interactive exhibits on deep-sea biology and larval ecology produced for small museums and aquaria on the coasts of Oregon, Washington and North Carolina.  <br/><br/>Reliable estimates of connectivity among metapopulations are increasingly important in marine conservation biology, ecology and phylogeography, yet biological parameters for biophysical models in the deep sea remain largely unavailable. The movements of deep-sea vent and seep larvae among islands of habitat suitable for chemosynthesis have been inferred from current patterns using numerical modeling, but virtually all such models have used untested assumptions about biological parameters that should have large impacts on the predictions. This project seeks to fill in the missing biological parameters while developing better models for predicting the dispersal patterns of methane seep animals living in the Gulf of Mexico and on the Western Atlantic Margin. Despite the existence of similar seeps at similar depths on two sides of the Florida peninsula, the Western Atlantic seeps support only a subset of the species found in the Gulf of Mexico. It is hypothesized that the ability of larvae to disperse through the relatively shallow waters of the Florida Straits depends on an interaction between the adult spawning depth and the dispersal depth of the larvae. Dispersal depth, in turn, will be influenced by larval flotation rates, swimming behaviors, feeding requirements, and ontogenetic migration patterns during the planktonic period.  The recently developed SyPRID sampler deployed on AUV Sentry will be used to collect larvae from precise depth strata in the water column, including layers very near the ocean floor. Larval traps deployed on the bottom at three depths in each region will be used in conjunction with the plankton collections to determine what proportion of larvae are demersal. Comparisons of stable oxygen isotopes between larval and juvenile mollusk shells will provide information on the temperatures (and therefore depths) that larvae develop, and geochemical analyses of larval and juvenile shells will determine whether larval cohorts mix among depth strata. Ocean circulation and particle transport modeling incorporating realistic biological parameters will be used to predict the movements of larvae around the Florida Peninsula for various spawning depths and seasons.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A significant portion of the marine carbon reservoir is made up of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), yet much still needs to be learned about the processes controlling its removal (sinks). Especially crucial is identifying how DOC get incorporated into the microbial loop, or the cycling of carbon through biological processes. This project aims to study the creation of microgels from pools of DOC. Microgels are the product of DOC aggregating to form a particle-type of a DOC conglomerate, which makes it more biologically accessible. About 10-30% of the DOC pool is estimated to form these microgels, so a significant segment of the marine carbon cycle will be illuminated more clearly through this research. A vast variety of processes could influence the development of these microgels, so the researchers are including a study of various environmental controls such as temperature and pH. With these parameters and more, the investigators will potentially be able to not only develop and explain the mechanisms of microgel formation, but also the effect which climate change (warming and acidification of the ocean) will have on this process and how that will affect marine biological processes. Additionally, a postdoctoral researcher will be supported through this project, as well as the training of 20 high school teachers, one undergraduate and two high school students. The investigators will develop a high school curriculum that will focus on connecting science to the students' local natural world, which has been shown to improve student learning.<br/><br/>The involvement of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the microbial loop is overall still a mystery due to the fact that DOC mechanics are poorly understood. The assembly of microgels from dispersed DOC pools may be a critical factor in studying the bioreactivity of DOC in the open ocean. This project aims to study the formation of DOC polymers in the North Pacific and assess their bioreactivity under a variety of environmental conditions (pH, temperature). Deep North Pacific water contains very low DOC (35 µM) yet has the oldest radiocarbon ages (up to 6000 years old) known in the open oceans, which makes it an ideal test site due to the low bioreactivity end member. The goal of this research is to develop mechanistic models of the aggregation of DOC polymers into microgels under a variety of environmental conditions and potentially use that information to describe the potential climate change effects on these processes."

They are key players in spring phytoplankton blooms, which in turn support food webs that include productive fisheries. In addition, these photosynthetic diatom cells are known to capture enormous amounts of carbon, which are exported to depth as blooms die off. In oceanic systems, this process effectively removes carbon from the atmosphere for thousands of years. However, the biological mechanisms that lead to carbon sequestration, the transfer of carbon from the atmosphere into the deep ocean, are not well understood. As diatom populations reach the end of the bloom cycle, individual cells start to deteriorate and undergo cell death. The collapse of diatom populations is regarded as a critical point (or tipping point), which can be predicted by understanding the genetic activity of the population. This project seeks to elucidate how environmental change influences diatom cell-death processes. A mechanistic understanding of these cellular processes will elucidate how climate change could alter carbon-removal from the atmosphere and affect ocean productivity. The knowledge and methods developed during this study are applicable across organisms from all domains of life. The broader impacts of this project are focused on high school education and new ideas and approaches for three-dimensional learning opportunities in support of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Specifically, researchers are working with high school educators and partners to teach concepts of systems approaches, tipping points, and carbon sequestration in the marine environment through educational modules.<br/><br/>The goal is to determine the structure of diatom populations during the transition of actively growing cells towards population collapse by identifying the point of commitment (tipping point) at the level of individual cells. The model system is the diatom, Thalassiosira pseudonana, which is widespread and a common bloom-forming species. The random decision process of individual diatom cells is being characterized by establishing a genome-wide gene expression space through the physical and biochemical characterization of the cells. Implementation of the project is focused on measuring the phenotypic responses in the diatom to environmental factors including severe stress. Transcriptomic analyses during the transition of cell proliferation towards culture collapse include bulk (RNA-Seq) and single-cell (scRNA-Seq) high-throughput sequencing. Using a systems biology approach, the genetic information obtained from the samples is incorporated into predictive models to identify genetic transitions that occur prior to population collapse. The systems approach can detect changes in transcriptomic state that precede a critical point in the cell death process leading to predictions of how diatoms respond to environmental change.  This work opens new vistas for the elucidation of mechanistic pathways of diatom cell populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Sun, however, is much more complex, and it is therefore unclear whether models that work under ideal conditions resemble on the actual Sun.  The aim of this three-year research project is to test a popular model of solar eruptions, ""the standard 3D model,"" under realistic conditions by modeling real eruptions using photospheric observations to drive active-region-scale coronal MHD simulations.  The project team will devote a significant amount of time and effort to compare their numerical simulations to real solar observations.  The research study will have three parts: (i) perform data-driven MHD simulations; (ii) compare the simulations with observations; and, (iii) use the simulations to test predictions of ""the standard 3D model.""  For a sample of eruptive regions, the project team will construct nonlinear force-free extrapolations from vector magnetograms, about an hour before each eruption.  These extrapolations will be used to initialize the zero-beta MHD simulations driven by flow maps inferred from spectro-polarimetric data using optical-flow methods that treat the induction equation consistently.  The team will also model a set of non-eruptive regions as an important control: they will aim to demonstrate that their method does not produce eruptions when none occurs in reality.  They will use their simulations to test the predictions of ""the standard 3D model"" regarding the instability mechanism responsible for eruption (e.g., torus instability) and mode of reconnection during the eruption (e.g., slipping reconnection).  The inclusion of control regions will indicate whether or not these features are essential for an eruption to occur, and not just simply being present but remain unimportant during the eruption process.  The team will identify the instability mechanism, sites and nature of reconnection in their simulations.<br/><br/>To date, ""the standard 3D model"" of solar eruptions has been tested extensively using MHD simulations with simple bipolar magnetic fields.  This three-year research project takes the important next step to test the model under realistic conditions.  The intellectual merit of this work is to establish the viability of ""the standard 3D model.""  The project also aims to provide new physical insight into the basic mechanisms of magnetic energy storage and release in the solar atmosphere, which are important in a general astrophysical context.  A novel aspect of the research project is the significant amount of work devoted to validating the data-driven MHD simulations; although this type of simulations is becoming increasing common in recent years, their validation is typically of a secondary consideration and it often relies on by-eye comparisons between EUV loops and field lines from the simulation, for example.  The project team will devote a significant amount of time and effort to developing metrics for making quantitative comparisons between simulations and observations, which is a necessary step for objective validation.<br/><br/>The anticipated results of this three-year project will be of interest to the space weather community: an improved understanding of solar eruptions will also improve our predictive capability for these events.  The methodology and metrics for comparing numerical simulations to real observations that will be developed as part of this project will be of general use to the solar community; the project team will make their tools available to the broader community online.  All their project data will be made available to the public too.  The team also plans to organize a special session at the SHINE Workshop in the last year of the project focused on critically assessing the 3D standard model using different MHD models.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This event is termed the mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum (MMCO) and it was the last global warming event before the Ice Age. Still, what caused the warming and how it affected plants and animals remains unclear. This project uses plant fossils preserved in lake sediments in Washington, Idaho and Oregon to study how ecosystems changed during the MMCO. Specifically, the researchers will investigate whether CO2 (a greenhouse gas) emitted from Pacific Northwest (PNW) volcanoes during the mid-Miocene helped heat the atmosphere, how climate changed in the PNW, and how local plant communities adjusted to these changes. Mid-Miocene ecosystems were similar to today; therefore, learning about the MMCO helps predict what may happen to today's ecosystems experiencing climate change. Several graduate and undergraduate students are being trained, and a new display featuring MMCO research in the Burke Museum is being created. <br/><br/>This project examines the causes and effects of mid-Miocene warming through the study of 18 exceptional PNW paleofloras from before, during and after the MMCO. Together, the floras form a sequence of linked data on atmospheric pCO2, regional climate change, and vegetation that can be precisely dated. The floras often preserve macrofossils, pollen, and phytoliths, providing an integrated view of local and regional climate and vegetation. Project aims are to: (1) do high-precision U-Pb geochronology on volcanic ashes at 13 floral sites across the MMCO; (2) study plant assemblages at all 18 sites to infer (a) vegetation composition, diversity, structure, and successional stage, (b) local-regional climate, and (c) atmospheric pCO2; and (3) use these data to evaluate the nature and timing of PNW ecosystem change during the MMCO.

Among the most important and basic climate system components are the heat, freshwater, and carbon content and transport of the oceans, which directly interact with other essential components of the climate system in the atmosphere and cryosphere. In turn the associated variability and trends in the ocean's carbon content, carbonate saturation state, oxygen, and nutrients impact its internal biological environment, with notable large-scale regional changes.  This joint study of the ocean carbon cycle and circulation is critical to identify critical areas where changes in ocean circulation could have serious consequences for future anthropogenic carbon uptake. Global warming-induced changes in the ocean's transport of heat and freshwater, which could affect the circulation, are being followed through these long-term measurements.  Results to date have shown that the abyssal ocean is warming, taking up to 30% of the excess heat in the entire Earth system, leading to changes in circulation patterns and ventilation rates in the upper ocean. The uptake of anthropogenic carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean has been mapped and shows that the oceans are acidifying. Oxygen concentrations are declining in the ocean thermocline, and tropical oxygen minimum zones are expanding. The project is based on the fundamental concept that data collected belong to the community and need to be made quickly and freely available to the community at large through a recognized international data center. The project will continue to promote training and learning for graduate students, postdoctoral scientists, and new scientists in sea-going work. Outreach activities will continue as opportunities arise.<br/><br/>The systematic and global re-occupation of select ocean hydrographic sections conducted for the past decade (2003-2014) will be extended into the 2015-2020 period with the continued objective of quantifying changes in the full-depth ocean. The project is in support of the U.S. CLIVAR (CLImate Variability and predictability) and the Carbon Science Programs, and is a component of a global observing system for the physical climate and carbon system. This long-standing project continues to contribute to the following overlapping scientific objectives: Data for Model Calibration, Validation and Model Based Synthesis; Carbon System Studies; Heat and Freshwater Storage and Flux Studies; Deep and Shallow Water Mass and Ventilation Studies; and Calibration of Autonomous Sensors. By integrating the scientific needs of the carbon, tracer and hydrographic communities, major scientific synergies and cost savings will continue to be achieved. In addition to efficiency, the coordinated approach produces scientific advances that exceed those of having individual programs. An average of two sections will be conducted every year, sometime collaboratively with international partner. The measurements made on each section include hydrography (full-depth vertical profiles of salinity, temperature, oxygen, nutrients, currents), Underway surface temperature, salinity, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), air-sea fluxes, bathymetry, navigation), carbon system (dissolved inorganic carbon, pCO2. Total Alkalinity, pH, dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen), and transient tracers. This project will collect the data and perform the quality control measures routinely carried out by providers of reference-quality data.

Summit is the only year-round, high-elevation, free-tropospheric, inland environmental observatory in the Arctic, and fills a unique niche in the international scientific community's global observing system. The Summit Station Science Coordination Office is an advisory body that serves the scientific community, the National Science Foundation's Arctic Research Support and Logistics Program and the Arctic Research Support & Logistics Services contractor by making recommendations about ways to accommodate or mitigate conflicting requests from different science teams working at Summit and suggesting ways that projects might reduce their logistical footprint. The Science Coordination Office also suggests science-based priorities for capital investments by the National Science Foundation at Summit. The Science Coordination Office strives to develop a true community of Summit users through open communication and by encouraging shared use of resources and key data sets. It also endeavors to focus the Summit community on the transformative questions identified by the participants at the Summit Station Science Summit in March 2017 and encourages the community to synthesize available data to identify innovative approaches to address these knowledge gaps.<br/>     <br/>The Science Coordination Office advances discovery and understanding of processes acting across the interior of the Greenland Ice Sheet while promoting teaching, training, and learning. New features of the GEO Summit website, aimed specifically at new Principal Investigators, will provide rich web content for interested students and the general public.  Over the next three years opportunities to interface with the new Greenland Climate Research Centre in Nuuk and add website content tailored to Greenlandic students and researchers will be actively pursued. The ability to quickly link to content about Summit Station will enable outreach programs by Summit researchers to increase their impact. Much effort in this project will be placed towards encouraging broad dissemination of results to enhance scientific and technical understanding. This will be accomplished by continuing to provide a clearinghouse for accessing Summit data, an extensive Summit bibliography, and a detailed list of planning activities to avoid duplicate collection of data at Summit.

In other words, does biodiversity loss increase the abundance of parasites by eroding natural checks and balances on transmission? Alternatively, does it decrease parasite abundance by removing the free-living biodiversity on which parasites depend? This study will constitute the first comprehensive test of these questions in any ecosystem by evaluating the relationship between fish biodiversity and parasite abundance across 18 replicate coral reef ecosystems. Not only will the project explore whether reductions in fish biodiversity are associated with increases or decreases in parasite burdens, it will also assess whether parasite and host traits or geographical distance influence the direction and strength of this relationship. The theories to be tested are among the most important and controversial in the rapidly growing field of disease ecology and this work represents a novel, creative approach to a long standing, but unresolved research question. The project will yield transformative insights into the nature of parasite transmission in a changing world. Furthermore, it will intimately intermingle education with research by launching the Research Internship in Molecular Ecology at California State Monterey Bay, which will place a group of underrepresented undergraduates in a central research role, and by developing and disseminating quality educational tools for teaching about parasite biodiversity through collaboration with the Network of Conservation Educators and Practitioners at the American Museum of Natural History. Parasites are often hidden and can be easy to overlook, but they are ecologically important and affect every population of marine animals. <br/> <br/>The field of disease ecology is plagued by uncertainty and disagreement over whether biodiversity loss exacerbates parasite transmission, because it lacks the comprehensive, multi-host, multi-parasite, broad-spatial-scale dataset needed to formulate a convincing empirical test.<br/>To answer this recalcitrant question, the PIs will generate a dataset of unprecedented replication and taxonomic and spatial resolution, by exploiting the advantages of a marine model system. The project is centered on a natural experiment in which the abundance of parasites will be quantified across a highly resolved gradient of host biodiversity, for more than 77 parasite species and 18 replicate coral reef ecosystems. The resulting dataset will critically test hypotheses for the biodiversity?parasite abundance relationship, revealing how the direction, shape, and scale-dependence of this relationship vary across a diverse array of parasite taxa, and resolving questions of burning interest in the disease ecology literature ? and of vital importance to marine conservation. This project will address the following questions: (Q1) For each parasite species detected, what is the direction and shape of the relationship between biodiversity and parasite abundance? (Q2) What factors (e.g., parasite traits like transmission strategy and host specificity, host traits like body size) determine the direction and shape of the relationship between biodiversity and parasite abundance? (Q3) How does spatial scale interact with parasite dispersal capacity to moderate the effects of biodiversity on parasite abundance? To address these questions, the project will integrate an existing dataset on fish biodiversity and abundance of coral reef fish parasites from six equatorial Pacific islands (the Northern Line Islands) with new sampling from 12 additional islands (the Southern Line Islands and French Polynesia). The resulting dataset will reflect the burden of >77 metazoan parasite taxa for seven species of coral reef fishes across18 islands. This work will provide the world's first data on the direction, magnitude, and shape of the biodiversity?disease relationship across a diversity of parasite taxa, host taxa, and spatial scales, and will comprehensively identify conditions under which biodiversity is likely to be important in determining the abundance of parasites ? a fundamental contribution to ecology and to biological oceanography. The project will also intimately integrate education with research by placing a group of underrepresented minority undergraduates in a central research role: performing the molecular analyses required to estimate parasite dispersal distance. A summer Research Internship in Molecular Ecology will be established at California State University Monterey Bay, a Hispanic-Serving Institution. The project will also underwrite the development of a peer-reviewed learning module on parasite biodiversity, to be developed and disseminated in collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History, and will support the training of two graduate students, one postdoctoral scholar, and several undergraduates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In cities, humans have intensively reconfigured the landscape and extensively concentrated resources. These urban environs are expected to host almost all future global population growth. If and how cities will remain livable in the future, however, is a critical question.  Key factors of livability include a comfortable environment, access to and efficient use of water, and resilience to extremes of drought, flood, cold, and heat.  Natural science suggests that these factors are strongly related to the vegetation cover, soils, and heat and water balances of a place, but it is an open question how precisely lessons from natural science conducted in rural, natural areas might apply to cities. Among the most prominent, unique characteristics of cities are their extreme spatial variations in land cover (e.g., grass, pavement, trees, gardens, and bare ground juxtaposed over short distances) and the phenomenon called the urban heat island (UHI). An UHI occurs where an urban area is substantially warmer than nearby rural areas due to factors such as greater absorption of solar energy by paved surfaces and less evaporative cooling from dry urban surfaces than rural fields or forests. This project will determine (1) how urban landscape variations, heat, and water balances interact as cause and consequence of local hot or cool microclimates within the city, (2) how microclimates and their vegetative and hydrologic influences relate to urban human health and comfort, and (3) how the overall UHI climate and hydrologic regime of cities may be made more resilient to weather extremes for the benefit of urban infrastructure, urban environmental quality, and urban human safety. To the extent that the linked surface water and energy balances of a city might be controlled by is landscape composition and configuration, with sufficient knowledge of urban heterogeneity-heat-water relations, cities could be engineered for greater health and sustainability, even in the face of global change. <br/><br/>The dual goals of this project are to (1) quantify the links and feedbacks between urban landscape heterogeneity, urban heat, and the urban water cycle and (2) to forge a strong pipeline between science, education, and management to help empower people of all abilities and positions to develop practices to enhance the comfort and resilience of urban landscapes in the face of global change. The research will address how the distributed surface water and energy balances of the urban environment function, whether they function differently in urban heat or cool islands, how they are governed by various types of land cover, and how they in turn affect water resource demands and human comfort. Research approaches will include in situ quantitative monitoring of the heat and water balances of the most common urban land covers subject to the same microclimate island and compared among different microclimates; field, remote sensing, and modeling investigation of urban soil moisture's controls on urban warming; physics-based numerical modeling of urban landscape composition and configuration controls on microclimate, surface energy balance, and surface water balance; and remote sensing and modelling assessments of how progressive urbanization and warming and the scale of data considered may influence the quantifications of urban heat and water cycles. This project will also foster research-education-management synergy with multiple open-access innovations. Urban environmental science field course modules will be developed for a variety of age levels (pre-school to graduate) to foster place-based, experiential, and life-long STEM learning. The modules will also be explicitly designed to make field science accessible to students with mobility needs. Research-management collaboration will occur among a consortium of western US cities and universities and public outreach on ""urban backyard science"" will freely distribute educational urban-environment activities for all ages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the time of this event, the Indian Subcontinent was in the midst of geographic and geological upheaval. As it migrated northward across the equator, it passed over a volcanic hot spot that breached the crust and led to massive outpouring of basalt lava onto the continent forming the Deccan Traps. The effects of these events on India's land biota remain poorly understood due to understudy of India's geological and paleontological record during this time. The goals of this project are to improve understanding of (1) the timing and nature of Deccan volcanism and (2) its biological effects in continental organisms. Improved understanding of the biotic response to major geographic and geologic changes in India will allow comparisons with the record in North America and will inform studies of the interchange of organisms that resulted from India's subsequent collision with Asia.<br/><br/>This project brings together expertise in paleontology and Deccan Trap volcanology, geophysics, geochronology, sedimentology and stratigraphy of Trap-associated deposits. Traditional geological and paleontological techniques will be employed, as well as state-of-the-art radioisotopic dating, chemical fingerprinting, and study of magnetism preserved in basalts that are associated with key fossil beds. Research conducted as part of this project will be incorporated into Immersive Virtual Field Trips (iVFTs), which are cyber-learning applications that allow teachers to virtually take students to scientifically significant but inaccessible environments. iVFTs use location-based high-resolution spherical content, 360° panoramic video, giga-pixel imagery, and unique viewpoints via unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) to develop interactive, content-rich, and learner-driven virtual field explorations, experienced online via HTML5."

During mountain building, rocks that were once deeply buried often become exhumed and transported to the Earth?s surface. This project will investigate a region of central Idaho that experienced an ancient collision between an ocean island system and the North American continent, which resulted in exhumation of rocks that were buried as deeply as 40 kilometers. This study will test whether a portion of the lower crust detached from the overlying tectonic plate and subsequently sank into the mantle below, causing the overlying rocks to be uplifted towards the surface, or alternatively whether movement along steep faults resulted in their exhumation. To evaluate these hypotheses, rock samples will be collected and evaluated to give information on when, and at what rates, these deep rocks were translated towards the surface. The results of this project will improve our understanding of the tectonic processes that are active during plate collisions and mountain building events, which can impact the distribution and quality of geologic resources. This project will improve STEM education by generating field-based learning and research opportunities for undergraduates and graduate students at Washington State and Missouri State universities. The results of this project will introduce STEM research to undergraduates each year through geology lectures. Grade-appropriate presentations will be developed for K-12 students to introduce them to their local geology and allow for the discussion of STEM careers.<br/><br/>Quantifying the contributions of processes that exhume deep-seated metamorphic rocks during collisional tectonics is fundamental for understanding how mountain belts evolve. In the North American Cordilleran orogen in central Idaho, the Salmon River suture zone is a ~30 kilometer-wide region that experienced Jurassic-Early Cretaceous contractional deformation associated with collision of a volcanic island arc terrane with the western edge of the North American continent. Rocks in the suture zone record structural burial to and subsequent exhumation from depths as great as 40 kilometers, and therefore are ideal for investigating the processes that drive high-magnitude exhumation during accretionary events. This project will test two primary hypotheses: 1) Rocks in the Salmon River suture zone were exhumed via hinged unroofing following lithospheric delamination, which predicts contemporaneous exhumation-related cooling across the width of the suture zone and eastward-increasing exhumation rates and magnitudes; or 2) Rocks in the Salmon River suture zone were exhumed via forward-breaking thrust propagation, which predicts a systematic westward younging of the timing of peak burial, initial exhumation, and motion on thrust faults. To test these hypotheses, this project will integrate structural analysis and geochronology of field relationships, the timing and pressure-temperature conditions of peak metamorphism, and multi-part temperature-time paths as a proxy for exhumation-related cooling. The results of this project will have implications for our understanding of the geodynamic processes that operate during accretionary events. In addition,  project results will address the existence, scale, and effects of lithospheric removal, and the temporal and spatial relationships between accretion-related burial and associated shortening and exhumation in the overlying middle and upper crust.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project focuses on the missing interval between these two events and uses ancient soils to learn about the environment when these ancient landscapes formed.  Twelve undergraduate students will be engaged in research experiences that will incorporate field and laboratory techniques that are in wide use in the geosciences.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to characterize terrestrial environments following the eruption of the Columbia River Basalts in southeastern Washington and northeastern Oregon, and to reconstruct the geological processes that shaped the landscape in this area.  This will be accomplished by creating a network of field sites across the southeastern Columbia Basin that expose weathered basalt contacts and paleosols. At each site the morphology of the contact and underlying basalt will be characterized, and samples will be collected for lab analyses of micromorphological features and bulk chemical abundances.  Lava flows are exposed throughout the region at different elevations, allowing for the study of precipitation gradients and their influence on basalt weathering, and to measure differences in pedogenesis caused by exposure time or thermal diagenesis.  These analyses will provide the ability to (i) better understand the timing of Cascade uplift and the subsequent aridification of the Columbia Basin, (ii) reconstruct the landforms caused by periods of glacial outburst flooding that predate the most recent Ice Age floods and (iii) distinguish original soil weathering from post-burial processes.

This project is designed to improve model simulations of sea ice and examine the role of wind and wave forcing on changes in sea ice around Antarctica.<br/><br/>This project seeks to explain basic interactions of the coupled atmosphere, ocean, and ice dynamics in the Antarctic climate system, especially in the region near the sea ice edge.  The summer evolution of sea ice cover and the near surface heat exchange of atmosphere and ocean depend on the geometric distribution of floes and the open water surrounding them. The distribution of floes has the greatest impact on the sea ice state in the marginal seas, where the distribution itself can vary rapidly. This project would develop and implement a model of sea ice floes in the Los Alamos sea ice model, known as CICE5. This sea ice component would be coupled to the third generation WaveWatch model within the Community Climate System Model Version 2. The coupled model would be used to study sea ice-wave interactions and the role of modeling sea ice floes in the Antarctic.

The goal of this project is to understand the role of such acids on the deformation of polycrystalline ice by comparing the deformation behavior of pure and sulfuric acid-doped samples. Sulfuric acid was chosen both because of its importance for interpreting past climate and because it can lead to water veins in ice at low temperatures. This work will focus on the location, movement, and impact of acids in polycrystalline ice that are more complex than in single crystals of ice. By deforming samples and performing microstructural characterization, the role of acids on deformation rate, grain evolution, and the movement of the acids themselves, will be assessed. The work will lead to the education of a Ph.D. student at Dartmouth College, introduce undergraduate students to research at both the University of Washington and Dartmouth College. <br/><br/>Despite the ubiquitous use of the constitutive relation for ice commonly referred to as ""Glen's Flow Law"", significant uncertainty exists particularly with regard to the role of impurities and the development of oriented fabrics. The aim of this project is to improve the constitutive relationship for ice by performing deformation tests and microstructural characterization of pure and sulfuric acid-doped ice. The project will focus on sulfuric acid's impact on ice viscosity, fabric evolution, and diffusivity. Sulfuric acid can have both direct and indirect effects on the mechanical properties of polycrystalline ice.  The direct effects change the dislocation velocity and/or density, and the indirect effects change the grain size and fabric. The complexity and interaction of these effects means that it is not possible to understand the effects of sulfuric acid by simply examining ice core specimens. In this project, the team will deform four types of ice: lab-grown ice samples doped with similar-to-natural concentrations of sulfuric acid, lab-grown high-purity ice, layered doped and pure ice, and natural ice from Antarctic ice cores. Deformation will be performed in both uniaxial compression and simple shear. The addition of simple shear tests is critical for relating the laboratory-observed deformation behavior to the behavior of polar ice sheets where the shear strain dominates ice motion in basal ice. After deformation to strains from 5 percent up to 25 percent, the microstructural development will be assessed with methods including a variety of scanning electron microscope techniques, Raman microscopy, synchrotron-based Nano-X-ray fluorescence, and ion chromatography. These analysis techniques will allow the determination of 1) the segregation and movement of impurities, 2) the rate of grain-boundary migration, 3) the number of recrystallized grains; and 4) the full orientation of the ice crystals. The results will enable both microstructural modeling of the effects of sulfuric acid and numerical modeling of diffusion in ice cores. The net result will be a better understanding of ice deformation that improves ice-core interpretation and ice-sheet modeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The best pressure sensors drift unpredictably so their output cannot be used to resolve long terms signals such as the steady buildup of strain between subduction zone earthquakes and long term changes in the mass of the oceans.  Drift also makes existing pressure sensors less sensitive to shorter-term signals such as those from slow-slip earthquakes and ocean eddies. A new method has been developed to remove drift using the internal pressure inside the instrument housing as a reference and has been tested successfully with a seafloor prototype.  This project will redesign the prototype so that the instrument is more robust, better calibrated, more compact and lower power.  It will be attached to the Ocean Observatories Initiative Cabled Array on Axial Seamount, a volcano that is inflating rapidly following an eruption in 2015.  The engineering effort will be led by a female engineer in a field where women are underrepresented and the project will train a graduate student in a technical project where they will learn to work with both engineers and scientists.  The cruises that service and deploy instruments on the Ocean Observatories Initiative Cabled Array incorporate a large number of undergraduate students, and one will be engaged to conduct a project related to this instrument.<br/><br/>The A-0-A method is a new approach to calibrating pressure sensors to remove drift.  Periodically, a valve is used to switch the pressure sensor for a short interval from measuring the pressure in the ocean to measuring the pressure inside the instrument housing.   The drift can then be determined by comparing the pressure readings to an accurate barometer. The A-0-A method has the potential to substantially reduce the drift of long-term seafloor pressure records in a much more economical way than current approaches.  The first non-proprietary seafloor tests at 900 m in Monterey Bay on the MARS cabled observatory suggests that A-0-A calibrations may reduce pressure sensor drift to as little as 1-2 mm/year in 1000 m of water.  However, design improvements are required to remove known sources of error and a side-by-side seafloor test is essential to verify the technique against established methods of drift removal.  The first deployment of the redesigned instrument on Axial Seamount will allow comparisons with the absolute pressure measurements of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Self-Calibrating Pressure Recorder (an instrument that uses a dead weight tester for periodic calibrations) and the relative pressure measurements obtained from repeat closed-loop mobile pressure recorder surveys, both of which have an uncertainty of ~1 cm of water. The cabled sensor can then be used for future vertical geodetic studies of the Cascadia subduction zone megathrust aimed at understanding patterns of fault locking, creep and slow slip.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is particularly true for the continental margin off Oregon and Washington State and Southern Canada, which is called the Cascadia Margin. This is because this ~1000 kilometer-long subduction zone fault has been locked since its last rupture in 1700 which produced a magnitude 9 earthquake that resulted in a large tsunami that impacted the Pacific Northwest and Japan and triggered significant underwater landslides. Gaining access to deep subduction zone fluids, however, is challenging because they are largely inaccessible, occurring at great depth below the seafloor. However, in 2015, a seep site was discovered off the Oregon coast where a jet of warm, hydrocarbon-enriched, low-salinity fluid was found venting from the seafloor. This site, called Pythia's Oasis, is unlike any seep site yet discovered, providing possible access, for the first time, to fluids formed deep within the Cascadia Subduction Zone. A second adjacent site includes an extensive collapse zone hosting multiple seeps that issue diffuse flows of warm and/or low salinity, methane-rich fluids that support dense microbial and macrofaunal communities. The goal of this two-year collaborative research project is to characterize the geology and chemistry of this extraordinary environment to test hypotheses about the origin of these fluids. This will be done using a remotely operated vehicle and an autonomous underwater vehicle from the National Deep Submergence Facility at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, heat flow probes, coring devices, and geochemical tracers and analyses. If these fluids come from deep in the subduction zone, this site will provide an unprecedented opportunity to study high-temperature fluid sources and reactions in the only segment of the Cascadia Subduction Zone that is inferred to be seismically active. Results of the work have implications for understanding deep-seated fluid and seismogenic processes acting in other subduction zones as well. Broader impacts include an extensive at-sea student training program in which at least 10 undergraduate and graduate students will participate on the 13-day sea-going field expedition to the site where they will learn about and participate in seagoing activities and the discovery processes. The students will work alongside experienced scientists and ship and deep submergence vehicle crews to conducting their own research using data collected on the cruise and by later onshore analyses. Public outreach will be carried out via students who will communicate their experiences and findings through a cruise website and formal and informal presentations, with messaging focused on K-20 opportunities in integrated oceanography-engineering programs. <br/><br/>This research will characterize the geology and chemistry of the extraordinary new discovery of a seep site, called Pythia's Oasis, that is located on the Cascadia Subduction Zone. Three hypotheses on the source of these fluids will be tested: (1) that the fluids are meteoric and play no role in the seismogenic behavior of the margin but may contribute to element transport between land and ocean, impacting the current understanding of coastal hydrogeology; (2) that the fluids originate from smectite-illite dehydration in the accreted sediments, rather than at the plate boundary, providing important information on fluid production and overpressure development within the accretionary prism above the plate boundary; and (3) that the fluids originate from high temperature metamorphic reactions at depth in the seismogenic region of the CSZ, resulting in extreme overpressures at the plate boundary.  In the latter case, the dehydration reactions may explain the partially locked behavior of the fault in this part of the continental margin or suggest that the locked seismogenic zone may not correspond to moderate overpressures as postulated for other subduction zone areas such as Nankai. off Japan, and off Costa Rica. Hypotheses will be tested by detailed geological characterization of the seep site; by thoroughly analyzing the seep and pore fluids using major and trace element geochemistry; by examining the gas chemistry and by isotopic analyses; and by heat flow and modeling studies. The field program will utilize the remotely operated vehicle, Jason, and the autonomous underwater vehicle, Sentry, from the Woods Hole Oceanographic National Deep Submergence Facility to complete photomosaics of the seafloor as well as bathymetric maps around the seep sites at 1-m resolution. Seep fluids will be collected using isobaric gas-tight fluid-volatile samplers with real-time temperature measurements to determine end-member fluid compositions. All pore water samples will be analyzed for salinity, pH, and alkalinity shipboard, and a subset of samples will be analyzed for sulfate by shipboard ion chromatography. Approximately 300 samples will be analyzed for Cl, SO4, Br, Ca, Mg, Na, K, and alkalinity. Select samples will be analyzed for Li, Rb, Cs, Ba, DIC, and O/H isotopes. Si, NH4, as well as the methane through pentane concentrations in pore water and vent fluids will be analyzed. Stable isotope ratios of C, D, H, CH4, He, Li, and Cl will also be determined. Detailed heat flow measurements around the venting sites will be obtained to constrain relative changes in thermal gradients. Precisely located push cores for sediment chemical and physical property and pore water analyses will be collected and analyzed. Water column sensors on Sentry will also provide eH and CTD-O2-turbidity characterizations of the near-bottom fluids. Gravity coring will allow direct sampling of pore fluids below the zone of mixing with seawater and will ensure capture of the advecting fluid signal. Upward advection rates will be estimated from solute profiles using a new, non-steady-state, reaction-transport model. The spatial distribution of flow constructed from Jason push cores around the seep and shipboard gravity cores will be used to estimate output fluxes of fluid and solutes. The EM302 multibeam system on the R/V Thompson will be utilized for imaging of the bubble plumes to determine spatial extent with implications for biological activity in the upper water column. To determine local current regimes and hence the most intense plume locations in the water column, the hull-mounted 75 kHz ADCP will be used to log current velocities during all surveys."

Coincident with this extinction, the Antarctic portion of the supercontinent of Pangea transitioned to a warmer climatic regime devoid of a permanent ice cap.  Compared to lower latitudes, relatively little is known about the survivors of the extinction in Antarctica, although it has been hypothesized that the continents more polar location shielded it from the worst of the extinctions effects.  As the result of a NSF-sponsored deep field camp in 2017/2018, a remarkable collection of vertebrate fossils was discovered in the rocks of the Shackleton Glacier region.  This collection includes the best preserved and most complete materials of fossil amphibians ever recovered from Antarctica, including two previously undescribed species.  This grant supports one postdoctoral researcher with expertise in fossil amphibians to describe and interpret the significance of these fossils, including their identification, relationships, and how they fit into the terrestrial ecosystem of Antarctica and other southern hemisphere terrestrial assemblages in light of the major reorganization of post-extinction environments.  Historical collections of fossil amphibians will also be reviewed as part of this work.  Undergraduate students at the University of Washington will be actively involved as part of this research and learn skills like hard tissue histology and CT data manipulation.  Public engagement in Antarctic science will be accomplished at the University of Washington Burke Museum, which is the Washington State museum of natural history and culture.  Specifically, a new exhibit on Antarctic amphibians will be developed as part of the paleontology gallery, which sees over 100,000 visitors per year.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>This two-year project will examine the evolution of Triassic temnospondyls based on a remarkable collection of fossils recently recovered from the Shackleton Glacier region of Antarctica.  Temnospondyls collected from the middle member of the Fremouw Formation are part of the first collection of identifiable tetrapod fossils from this stratigraphic interval. Thorough anatomical description and comparisons of these fossils will add new faunal information and also aid in determining if this horizon is Early or Middle Triassic in age.  Exquisitely preserved temnospondyl material from the lower Fremouw Formation will permit more precise identification than previously possible and will provide insights into the earliest stages of their radiation in the extinction recovery interval.  Overall, the Principal Investigator and Postdoctoral Researcher will spearhead an effort to revise the systematics of the Antarctic members of Temnospondyli and properly contextualize them in the framework of Triassic tetrapod evolution.  The research team will also take advantage of the climate-sensitive nature of fossil amphibians to better understand patterns of seasonality at high-latitudes during the early Mesozoic by subjecting selected fossils to histological analysis.  Preliminary data suggest that temnospondyls were exceptionally diverse and highly endemic immediately after the end-Permian extinction, when compared to their distribution before and after this interval.  If confirmed, this macroevolutionary pattern could be used to predict the response of modern amphibians to future climate perturbations.  Overall, this research will provide new insights into the vertebrate fauna of the Fremouw Formation, as well as shed light on the evolution of terrestrial ecosystems in southern Pangea in the wake of the Permian-Triassic mass extinction.  As part of the broader impacts, the research team will help to develop an exhibit featuring some of the best preserved fossils from Antarctica to explain to the public how paleontologists use fossils and rocks to understand past climates like the Triassic 'hot-house' world that lacked permanent ice caps at the poles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Coastal natural hazards such earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, and landslides pose research, planning, and communication challenges. These challenges create novel opportunities for advancing both fundamental knowledge as well as science to support the resilience of coastal communities and thus reduce the likelihood of coastal hazards resulting in disasters. The similarities of the Pacific Northwest coast to other coastal subduction zones on the Pacific Rim provide unique opportunities for comparative and collaborative research of global significance. Greater regional coordination of hazards research is needed, to leverage the scientific opportunities hazards in the region offer, as well as to meet community needs for place-specific hazards and risk science. The Cascadia Coastal Hazards Research Coordination Network (RCN) will engage stakeholders across academic, government, and tribal institutions to advance convergent coastal hazards and resilience research across the Pacific Northwest. <br/><br/>The RCN will build on existing coastal hazards research infrastructure and practice-based partnerships to integrate public and population health science and scientists into other disciplinary and interdisciplinary hazards research; enhance the understanding of the coastal hazards in subduction zone environments, as well as dynamic and cascading coastal hazards; and advance the development of integrated, interdisciplinary research questions and approaches across engineering, planning and policy, and geosciences, to mitigate risks and disasters from natural hazards in partnership with Pacific Northwest coastal communities. The Cascadia Coastal Hazards RCN will tackle fundamental questions on the mechanisms and consequences of interacting natural hazards in collaboration with potentially affected communities, in order to advance interdisciplinary simulation and modeling of coastal hazards. The RCN will also advance human-centered design and use-focused representations of and communications about coastal hazards modeling and simulation results, as well as the integration of geo- and engineering sciences with research on coastal policy and planning, informed by the risks to coastal community health in the face of disaster. The RCN will contribute to enhanced coastal community decision making, planning and resilience to coastal hazards, through advances in collaborative hazards and resilience research. By including members whose organizations research or aim to mitigate coastal hazards, the RCN steering committee will be constituted to liaise effectively with the primary coastal hazards and resilience-oriented organizations in the Pacific Northwest, including the Washington Coastal Hazards Resilience Network, state and federal research and management agencies. Through annual workshops and monthly cross-disciplinary seminars on coastal hazards, the RCN will also create research capacity in the region by providing graduate students with unique opportunities to learn, apply, and advance transdisciplinary coastal hazards sciences, and increase the diversity of this science workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
