Space weather can affect different technologies on the Earth, for example, geomagnetic storms can alter the signals from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) (called scintillation) and degrade their accuracy and reliability. The main educational goals of this project will be achieved through mentoring UG and graduate students, development of a new course ""Application of data science and machine learning to space weather prediction,"" and including a new space weather component in the ERAU summer school and Women in Science Embry-Riddle (WiSER) program. The outreach goals will be achieved through organizing a workshop ""Space weather effects on Air Traffic communication"" for ERAU Aviation majors and collaborating with the Daytona Beach HAM radio club to enthuse students and local community on space weather and its effect on radio communications.<br/><br/>While many attempts are underway to predict the global ionospheric state using Total Electron Content (TEC) and GNSS signal scintillation indices, little is done to understand and predict the local ionosphere in terms of the underlying mechanisms responsible for producing high latitude ionospheric irregularities using GNSS data and modeling.  The principal objectives of this study are to use the inverse method, a full 3D forward propagation model along with datasets from several established GNSS receivers to train machine learning (ML) algorithms in clustering of irregularities based on their sources and to assist with predicting the scintillation at a different time and frequency.  Thus, this project will develop an ML approach, and augment it with the state-of-the-art physics-based models and inversion method in predicting space weather effects.   Radio communication is critical to many civilian and military endeavors, therefore predicting the space weather effects on communication through irregularity physics will prove to be of great societal benefit.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the current rapid rate of climate change threatens the existence of coral reefs as they degrade because of thermal-stress events. Consequently, the coverage and coral composition of many coral reefs is changing. Most global models suggest that few if any reef corals will survive beyond the 2.5 degree Celsius temperature rise predicted for the tropical oceans within the next hundred years. Such predictions differ from recent field studies on coral reefs that show pockets where corals do not bleach and die. The disagreement between the global models and field assessments is a consequence of ignoring climate-change refuges; it is critical to locate the climate-change refuges and determine what circumstances are conducive for coral survival. The investigators will examine the global response of coral reefs to thermal stresses over the last two decades, and focus on the 2015-2017 El Nino event, which caused considerable thermal stress and coral bleaching. The investigators ask the question: Where are the coral reef 'bright spots' from the thermal-stress events? 'Bright spots' are considered as places with less than expected bleaching. The team will also assess why some localities are potential 'bright spots'. Identifying coral reef bright spots will help guide future conservation decisions by enabling managers to target reefs with specific characteristics, which could be protected from human encroachment and be designated as potential refuges from coral bleaching as climate change progresses. This project includes training of a post-doctoral fellow and a Ph.D student, and host a coral-bleaching workshop. This study will be of relevance to all persons that live and work near coral reefs. What happens to reef corals has cascading consequences on other reef-associated organisms, and also influences whether reefs can keep up with sea-level rise. <br/><br/>The current rapid rate of climate change threatens the existence of coral reefs as they degrade by thermal-stress events. A glimmer of optimism lies in the observation that thermal stresses vary spatially and temporally across the oceans, with the consequence that coral communities in different geographic regions, and under different local conditions, are likely to inherently differ in their capacity to tolerate thermal stress. One of the most transformative aspects of this work is in analyzing the extent to which the bleaching patterns differed from model predictions. This work will capitalize on the recent progress on Bright-Spots Analysis to assess unexpected outcomes. The investigators will take two approaches. First, the project will use a machine-learning algorithm, boosted regression trees to examine the relationships between coral bleaching and the environmental predictor variables of interest. Second, a series of generalized mixed effects models, within a hierarchical Bayesian framework, will be used to identify where geographically 'bright spots' from thermal stress are located and why some coral reefs are more susceptible to thermal stresses than others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These aquifers are complex hydrogeologic systems, where flow and transport predominantly occur through preferential flow paths or conduits that range in size from cm-scale openings to passages much larger than required for human access (caves). Despite their hydrologic importance, the location of karst conduits and characteristics of the larger aquifer are typically poorly constrained. To address these problems, we will monitor recharge-induced responses that arise as water flows into the subsurface in a karst aquifer in Florida using geophysical instrumentation to characterize the conduits, subsurface flow, and the larger karst system. The noninvasive remote sensing investigation will generate knowledge for direct societal benefit, including tools to improve the creation of karst hazards maps that highlight areas susceptible to sinkhole formation, the identification of preferential flow paths relevant to contaminant transport, and the development of a methodology to determine subsurface flow for water supply considerations. We will develop a temporary, interactive traveling exhibit in collaboration with the National Cave and Karst Research Institute that will frequent visitor centers near the field site in Florida and in New Mexico to increase public engagement and scientific literacy about karst hydrogeology and environmental seismology. The project will also contribute to the education of the next generation of the scientific workforce through the involvement of two graduate students at New Mexico Tech, an undergraduate student at the University of Florida, two undergraduate student interns through the IRIS undergraduate student intern program, and two early career scientists and a mid-career female scientist in an EPSCoR state. Finally, collected datasets will be incorporated into lecture material and homework sets of undergraduate and graduate courses at New Mexico Tech, which is a Hispanic-serving institution.<br/>A previous pilot study demonstrated the generation of seismic signals during artificial recharge experiments and a natural recharge event in a karst aquifer. These and other geophysical signals are caused by processes during flow through karst aquifers and includes pressure pulses generated as recharge enters conduits with full pipe flow, pore pressure changes in fractures and the rock matrix, mass loading induced subsidence due to changes in water mass, and turbulent interaction of flow with the wall rocks. To capitalize on the information content provided by these signals, we will use simultaneous, large-scale observations of recharge events at two co-located geophysical sensor networks to characterize the conduit network, flow processes within this network, and material properties of the larger karst system. Seismometers, tiltmeters, and other instruments will be deployed at the Santa Fe River Sink-Rise system in Florida to observe karst recharge events over a two-year period. This field site has a well-constrained conduit network, and thus it permits verification of the interpreted geophysical signals that arise from hydrologic processes. This transformative project will not only enable delineation of the karst conduit network, but will do so while providing a regionally integrated analysis of the karst aquifer flow system based on deformation observations on the timescales between fractions of a second to months. As recharge activates new flow paths, geophysical monitoring enables extensive 3D characterization of the dynamics and evolution of flow during recharge-induced changes in the aquifer. Furthermore, the signals will help to determine the architecture in the subsurface between the conduits and the surface, advancing knowledge of critical zone environments, for example, by specifically determining soil and regolith thicknesses and depths to the soil-rock interface. The young field of environmental seismology encompasses studies of a range of Earth surface processes, and this project will use and expand the respective methods to transform the understanding of karst aquifers across the full frequency range of deformation and develop techniques in preparation for a future karst critical zone observatory.<br/><br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The RCN for Resilient Rural Infrastructure will explore and achieve adaptive capacity and resilience for Gulf coastal communities, which has the potential to extend to infrastructure resilience of other rural communities in the United States. Understanding the factors that foster and support the efficacy of hurricane resilience in varying urban and rural settings can lead to strategies and policies that will optimize successful and all-inclusive future and long-term strategic adaptation and implementation plans. The initial focus is on the Florida Panhandle and will be expanded in years two and three to communities and institutions along the Gulf of Mexico coast. The activities of the new RCN include: Collectively develop a consensus-based mechanism for rural reliance; create a networking mechanism to recruit additional participants and update working groups; develop new research directions for identified subareas; evaluate the success of the network; and develop an innovative learning program for graduate students of diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>This RCN aims to foster a new understanding of the complex interactions among the key elements of community resilience in rural coastline areas. The RCN will work towards a set of new theories to explore hypotheses regarding how to achieve adaptive capacity and resilience in coastal communities. The RCN will bring together researchers from different fields, who otherwise would not be able to network together, to form working groups focusing on understanding within three thematic frameworks: Resilient rural infrastructure capacity and innovation; Governance and planning; and Community engagement. The network's research agenda will allow researchers to work towards solutions impacting people, their communities, and the future of lives in the communities. Through co-production of knowledge with the RCN's organizational and community partners, the development of new theories and methods will be enabled that could help community leaders and local officials planning capacity building and implementation decisions in preparing for and responding to shocks and in developing balanced sustainable solutions for both the human and natural environments. The network management team will implement a mechanism to promote diversity by recruiting graduate assistants and network participants.

The rationale for this proposal is that the isotopes of C, B, and S have already been used over a wide ranges of geological time scales to interpret changes in the Earth?s geochemical systems. Such work is being undertaken without some of the fundamental understanding of the processes which may alter these proxies. In addition to the more Modern samples, the PI will also study B within Neoproterozoic sections which have been proposed by some to have both retained their original geochemistry and by others to have been influenced by diagenesis.

This mission, which is scheduled to launch in the summer of 2018, will visit the near-Sun regions never explored before by any spacecraft, providing groundbreaking in-situ and close-by remote sensing measurements of the inner heliosphere between 9.5 and 55 solar radii (measured from the center of the Sun), reaching up to six times closer than the Helios mission.  This five-year CAREER project is aimed at improving present understanding of the evolution and structure of turbulence close to the Sun.  The project will also help elucidate how energy is transported from the solar surface to its upper atmosphere and how this energy is dissipated to heat the solar corona and accelerate the solar wind.  One of the main broader impacts of this project is that it will enhance the scientific return of the PSP mission by laying the theoretical foundations for interpretation of PSP measurements, which will have repercussions in a number of other outstanding questions in heliospheric physics.  The project team will introduce a novel and user friendly software tool that will allow students to use numerical simulations, with minimal knowledge of scientific computing, to enhance learning of introductory space plasma physics.  The role that numerical simulations will play in the introductory courses will closely mirror the role that simulations play in modern plasma research, i.e., to facilitate understanding of the underlying physics when analytical progress is no longer possible.  The software interface will allow students to quickly solve numerical problems to gain intuition from the numerical solution to help reinforce understanding of the underlying concepts.  Another main broader impact of this project is that, at its conclusion, a fully tested and working version of this tool will be made available online under the GNU open-source license, to allow for the expansion of its plasma physics problems base and use in other research institutions.  This software tool will also be adapted to disseminate with the general public the research outcomes of this project, and inform them on the relevance of space plasma research and the revolutionary discoveries that the PSP will enable in the decades to come.  The research and EPO agenda of this CAREER project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>This CAREER is expected to provide an improved understanding of the origin and evolution of turbulence in the near-Sun environment, from the Alfven waves observed in the low corona to turbulent fluctuations in the upper corona and the solar wind.  This investigation will combine theory, high-resolution numerical simulations and existing observations to lay the groundwork for the interpretation of the unprecedented measurements by the PSP.  The project aims to accomplish the following specific science goals: (i) Investigate how turbulence evolves from AW motions in the solar corona to fully developed AW turbulence at larger heliocentric distances; (ii) identify scaling laws governing the inertial-range power spectrum, the role of cross- helicity and residual energy in the turbulence and how such properties depend on the heliocentric distance; (iii) investigate the role that this turbulence plays in power laws of the magnetic energy spectrum of fluctuations observed by Helios measurements between 0.3 AU and 0.4 AU; and, (iv) establish predictions of the properties of turbulent fluctuations that the PSP will measure.  This CAREER investigation is also timely, because it will lay the theoretical and numerical framework needed for interpretation of the PSP signals before the first measurements become available at the end of 2018.  The outcome of this research combined with the future PSP observations will not only contribute to expand our knowledge of the fundamentals of Alfvenic turbulence in this region, but will lead to transformative advances towards determining the viability of Alfvenic turbulence as a major mechanism for the heating of the corona and the acceleration of the solar wind.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ecosystem-based protections near waterbodies, such as living shorelines, oyster reef and mangrove forest, are increasingly sought to enhance resilience to these climatic hazards; however, restoration projects and ecosystem-based defenses often fail because current understanding of erosion and sediment transport is based on simplified models of non-vegetated channels. This research will develop new scientific knowledge to illuminate effects of three-dimensional canopies (oyster reefs, seagrass beds, mangroves) on turbulent flow, movement of sediments, and sequestration of Blue Carbon (peat deposits). Using both laboratory flume and field experiments, the PI will test novel sediment transport theory within these complex natural habitats. Societal benefits of better understanding of erosional processes at vegetated river banks and shorelines are vast and transferable to aquatic systems around the world, allowing managers of vulnerable areas to plan impactful restoration projects and management strategies to mitigate effects of flooding, bank erosion, or sea level rise.

A Living Ecohydraulics Laboratory on an island in the field study area is where the next generation of student scientists will be trained at the intersection of ecology and engineering. <br/><br/><br/>This research will develop and test cutting-edge sediment transport theory, elucidating the roles of shear stress and turbulence on mass transport within diverse, complex aquatic habitats. In the field, the PI will test the hydrodynamic and sediment transport effects of 1) submerged, rigid canopies of oyster, 2) submerged, flexible canopies of seagrasses, and 3) emergent canopies of mangrove. Mass transport within these functionally diverse canopy types will be related to turbulence through field-coupled laboratory experimentation. Better understanding of shear stress-turbulence relationships for sediment transport across varied canopy types and flow regimes will fundamentally change the way that sediment transport is modeled in complex canopies and will significantly advance predictive ability regarding erosional and depositional processes in natural waterbodies.  Newly-developed sediment transport understanding will be linked to its applications in ecosystem restoration and design of nature-based infrastructure to promote greater resilience to climatic hazards. Educational activities include establishment of an island Living Ecohydraulics Laboratory to engage over 1400 learners and immerse 250 students into aquatic research sites over the life of the project. The integrated research-educational field experiences are targeted at influential academic stages, including middle-high school science research programs and summer camps, to attract and retain students who may have otherwise not chosen STEM careers. Display of middle and high school research projects in high-traffic community spaces will effectively engage community members in the research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Climate models indicate increasing temperatures and atmospheric moisture in the future, factors which can lead to stronger storms that produce more rain. To better understand how moisture is tied to rainfall in tropical systems, it is essential to assess the structures that produce rain within the storm ? the rainbands ? and the impact of moisture on those rainbands. This project will use geographic methods to measure storm structure and analyze how atmospheric moisture (also referred to as humidity) affects that structure. Rainbands will be  analyzed in dozens of tropical storms using ground-based radar and polar-orbiting satellite data. Metrics that quantify the shape, size, and evolution of rainbands are applied to these observations. By comparing rainband evolution in different moisture environments, this research will describe how rainband structural changes occur and the environmental moisture regimes that lead to high rain rates. <br/><br/>Through collaboration with scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), this project?s results will enable assessment of how accurately hurricane model forecasts depict rainband structure, an assessment that will help improve hurricane rainfall predictions.  In addition to funding graduate student research, each investigator will simultaneously teach a course that provides hands-on training in state-of-the art methods and includes collaborative learning opportunities for students to discuss research among the three universities.<br/><br/>This project will integrate geographic and meteorological methods to investigate two fundamental research questions about tropical cyclone (TC) size and structure: (1) How skillful are satellite and modeling datasets in representing cloud and precipitation structure and which three-dimensional object-based metrics best quantify these structures? (2) How does large-scale environmental moisture impact TC rainband development and rainfall production? Despite research that details the importance of environmental moisture at the synoptic-scale and within the TC inner core, few studies have combined radar, satellite, and modeling data to examine the influence of variable moisture on synoptic and mesoscale processes that impact TC size and structure (e.g, ventilation and shear-induced asymmetric circulations). <br/><br/>This research will provides crucial insight into model TC forecasts. By employing a novel shape-identification algorithm that is scalable across datasets with multiple spatial resolutions, this project will identify rainbands and tracks changes in rainband configuration to then identify how rainbands, and TC spatial extent more generally, are impacted by the TC?s moisture environment. The results from these analyses will be used to establish a multi-scale conceptual model of TC size and structure based on large-scale environmental moisture. Finally, object-based metrics will be applied to evaluate rainfall forecasts from current operational and experimental models by collaborating with the Hurricane Research Division of NOAA.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A key ingredient that makes life possible is a vast reservoir of water on the Earth's surface. However, the rocky interior of the Earth plays an important role in sustaining this surface liquid water over geological time scales. Liquid water facilitates weathering of surface rocks and minerals, and in the process, produces minerals such as clays and other hydrous mineral phases that can lock up the liquid water in their crystal structure. These hydrous minerals are the ultimate sinks for storing water at surficial conditions. If the weathering processes were to continue unhindered, all the liquid water on the Earth's surface could be potentially stored in the crystalline hydrous minerals in a time scale of a few billion years. The process of mantle convection in the rocky interior of the Earth helps in circulating this water stored in minerals back to the surface through dehydration and subsequent volcanism. Water at depth plays an important role in reducing the melting temperature of the rocks constituting the mantle. Water also gets incorporated as hydrogen defects in mantle minerals and affects their elastic and transport properties, including rheology and viscosity. This in turn facilitates mantle convection process in the Earth. Owing to the importance of water in the deep Earth processes, it is important to constrain how water is transported in to the Earth's interior and to determine how much water is stored in the rocky interior of the Earth. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award aims to address these fundamental questions by integrating research, training, and mentoring of the next generation of scientists and educators in the STEM fields and by making them aware of the importance of Solid Earth research for society. Undergraduate students through the Florida State University's Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) and high school students through the Young Scholar Program (YSP) will be involved in this research. The PI will also reach out to school students from underrepresented school districts, including Leon, Gadsden, Jefferson, and Hamilton counties in Florida and Thomas County in Georgia. The principal investigator (PI) will participate in educational and outreach activities hosted by the Challenger Learning Center. The PI and his team will present the outcomes from this project at international conferences, including the Fall American Geophysical Union (AGU) meeting. They will also participate in NSF-sponsored and community-driven workshops and conferences funded by NSF.<br/><br/>The overarching theme of this study will be to explore the high-pressure and temperature physical properties of hydrogen bearing mineral phases. In particular, the PI will use a combination of experiments and theoretical methods to examine the behavior of hydrogen and how it influences- elastic and transport properties such as diffusion and electrical conductivity of minerals at conditions relevant to the Earth's interior. The properties of hydrous minerals will be explored using vibrational spectroscopy, scattering and diffraction methods at both in house and international facilities. High-temperature elasticity of hydrogen bearing minerals will be examined using Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy. The experimental findings will be supplemented with first principles simulations. The constraints on elasticity and transport properties will be correlated with geophysical observations to put better constraints on the transport of water into the Earth?s interior and also the size of the water reservoir in the deep Earth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This training of a new user community increases the research output from NSF's investment in ISR facilities and contributes to the fundamental understanding of space weather in Earth?s atmosphere. this school also provides students with a background in radar theory, in learning to control and operate large radars, and an understanding of the data processing required to analyze radar data. All of this is directly transferable to other radar applications such as satellite tracking, weather radar, and satellite communications. In the school, facility PIs mentor students and establish professional relationships that extend beyond the school. Two of the core lecturing staff are female which provides important role models for students. The school often combines with the EISCAT ISR Summer School, fostering international relationships and communications. <br/><br/>Recognizing that incoherent scatter is a very powerful technique to make precise measurements of multiple upper atmospheric parameters extending from below 100 km to above 600 km, the NSF has heavily invested in several ISR facilities. However, due to an aging workforce and a shift in the U.S. educational curriculum away from ISR theory and engineering, the next generation of trained engineers is now being produced in Europe and Asia where ISR investments continue. This project addresses the need for training ISR users and workers in the US by conducting a yearly ISR summer school with a combination of lectures and group work. The purpose of this school is to teach students how to propose and conduct an ISR experiment, and how to analyze and report the results. As has been evidenced by students from the prior decade of summer schools, these students will often incorporate ISR data into future research and thus advance overall knowledge of the upper atmosphere.

""Megaripples"" are common features on marine sediments where bottom currents are rapid. In the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, these sand dune-like features are up to half a meter in height, with wavelengths reaching 20 meters. The investigators propose that megaripples act as large filter systems that rapidly convert dissolved and solid organic matter into inorganic carbon and nutrients, and thus influence the biological productivity of coastal waters. They propose to use a one-kilometer long megaripple field in the inlet of Chotawhatchee Bay, in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, as a natural laboratory for studying these processes. In addition, they will conduct laboratory experiments to investigate the filter processes at a smaller scale. By producing data on the functioning of megaripples, the project addresses a knowledge gap that has implications on our understanding of the cycles of matter in coastal waters. The project offers opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students in learning state-of-the-art techniques. The students will gain experience in working on high frequency data acquisition and analysis of 'big data'. To enhance outreach, the researchers will develop and teach two courses on Permeable Sediment Biogeochemistry and Aquatic Eddy Covariance Studies for the Saturday at the Sea program offered by Florida State University. Results will be disseminated via scientific journals, conference presentations and public lectures, and directly to the Apalachicola-National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR), which will make the results available to the other 28 NERR sites. <br/><br/>The two main project objectives are: 1) demonstrate the general function of megaripples as biocatalytical filters, and 2) demonstrate that common inlet megaripples contribute to nutrient retention in coastal bays.  A 1 km long megaripple field in the inlet of Chotawhatchee Bay (wavelengths: ~20 m, amplitudes: 20 to 40 cm) in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico will be used as an in-situ laboratory. Measurements will characterize megaripple topography and the water flowing over them. Salinity and suspended particles are utilized as natural tracers to quantify solute and particle entrainment into the megaripples. This project will deploy non-invasive aquatic eddy covariance instruments equipped with newly developed robust sensors to quantify sedimentary remineralization in the flushed megaripple bed. This technique integrates the benthic oxygen flux over a large section of the megaripple field, while including the natural dynamics of currents and light. Real-time water column measurements with a boat-mounted flow-through analyzer permit rapid quantification of large horizontal gradients of key water column parameters. The in-situ measurements will be combined with laboratory column reactor experiments that quantify nutrient re-mobilization through organic carbon mineralization in flushed megaripple sand. The megaripple field in the inlet of Chotawhatchee Bay is easily accessible from shore and by small boat, expediting instrument deployments and in-situ measurements while reducing project costs. Synthesis of all data will produce a conceptual and quantitative understanding of megaripples as natural biocatalytical filters. Because transport and reaction in megaripples are governed by basic physical and biogeochemical processes, these results will reveal information on the general biogeochemical functioning of megaripples that so far is not available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hence understanding the origin of continents and how portions of them remain stable for billions of years is central to understanding the evolution of the Earth. The old, stable cores of continents (cratons) are underlain by thick layers of mantle (the silicate layer of the Earth that lies below the crust), and these mantle roots are thought to contribute to continental stability. Yet, it remains debated how the continental mantle formed and evolved. In particular, the roles of magma or fluid interaction with the mantle, either during or after the continent formation, are unclear, although widespread layering observed in the cratonic mantle by seismic imaging may have been created by magma and fluid related processes. This research will constrain the formation and evolution of cratons by bracketing scenarios of melt/fluid and mantle reactions that are consistent with geophysical observations at mid-lithospheric depths. The research findings - disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and colloquia, and class room lectures and activities - will impact a wide range of Earth science sub-disciplines including petrology-geochemistry, mineral physics, geodynamics, and seismology. The proposal will support female PhD students in high P-T experimental petrology, mineral physics, and seismology, and support the research activities of several undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented groups. In addition to their own research, all the students will participate in discussions and write research articles together with all 3 PIs, learning how to combine concepts and methods from three different yet related sub-disciplines of solid Earth science. The proposal will thus directly further the educational experience and professional development of several students at various stages of their careers. The proposed research will also support an early career PI in the field of mineral physics and will aid the investigators in engaging K-12 students in science.<br/><br/>The stability of the continental interiors for 2-3 billion years is a key feature of the Earth's dynamical and thermal evolution. Understanding the geophysical structure, petrology, and material properties of cratonic mantles and the tectonic history that produced them is therefore one of the grand challenges of Earth science. A curious feature of subcontinental mantles is the presence of distinct reductions in seismic shear velocity at depths of 60-150 km, often called mid-lithospheric discontinuities (MLDs). Given the widespread occurrence of MLDs within cratons, their origins may be linked to craton formation; however, the causal link between MLD and craton formation is yet to be established, and MLD origins remain highly debated. One hypothesis is that MLDs represent zones enriched in CO2-H2O volatiles, which led to stability of hydrous and/or carbonate minerals or partial melts. This project will test this hypothesis by integrating results from experimental petrology, mineral physics, and seismology. Through laboratory experiments, this project will constrain the phase equilibria of cratonic mantle peridotites fluxed by mixed CO2-H2O volatiles at MLD depths, taking into consideration how the agent of volatile introduction may vary with craton formation models. The goal will be to determine the stability of hydrous and carbonate mineral phases over partial melts and obtain the compositions and proportions of mineral phases as a function of depth, temperature, and melt/fluid:peridotite ratio for each of the cases. Guided by the phase equilibria experiments and compiled xenolith data, thermoelastic properties of the appropriate end members and intermediate solid solutions of amphibole and mica will be determined using Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS) and first principles simulation. Using the mineral assemblages from experiments and updated elasticity data from new mineral physics, mantle velocity models will be predicted. These will be compared to mantle models for southern African craton (to be obtained by joint inversion of surface wave, Sp and Ps data) and North America, and used to calculate synthetic Sp and Ps receiver function stacks that will be compared to MLD observations globally. The proposed research will test whether one or several scenarios of fluid/melt infiltration into cratons, if any, satisfy the geophysical and petrologic characters of continental mantles at mid-lithospheric depths. Our research will also lead to specific products such as solidus parameterizations of depleted mantle+CO2+H2O; metasomatized mantle mineral assemblages as a function of P-T, infiltrated fluid/melt composition and fluid/melt:rock ratio; codes for computing seismic velocities for MLD-related assemblages with updated thermoelastic data; and observed mantle discontinuity parameters and mantle velocity models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Adult SBT migrate thousands of miles each year from high latitude feeding areas to lay their eggs in these tropical waters, where food concentrations on average are below levels that can support optimal feeding and growth of their larvae.  Many critical aspects of this habitat are poorly known, such as the main source of nitrogen nutrient that sustains system productivity, how the planktonic food web operates to produce the unusual types of zooplankton prey that tuna larvae prefer, and how environmental differences in habitat quality associated with ocean fronts and eddies might be utilized by adult spawning tuna to give their larvae a greater chance for rapid growth and survival success.  This project investigates these questions on a 38-day expedition in early 2021, during the peak time of SBT spawning.  This project is a US contribution to the 2nd International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE-2) that advances understanding of biogeochemical and ecological dynamics in the poorly studied eastern IO.  This is the first detailed study of nitrogen and carbon cycling in the region linking Pacific and IO waters.  The shared dietary preferences of SBT larvae with those of other large tuna and billfish species may also make the insights gained broadly applicable to understanding larval recruitment issues for top consumers in other marine ecosystems.  New information from the study will enhance international management efforts for SBT.  The shared larval dietary preferences of large tuna and billfish species may also extend the insights gained broadly to many other marine top consumers, including Atlantic bluefin tuna that spawn in US waters of the Gulf of Mexico.  The end-to-end study approach, highlights connections among physical environmental variability, biogeochemistry, and plankton food webs leading to charismatic and economically valuable fish production, is the theme for developing educational tools and modules through the ?scientists-in-the-schools? program of the Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies at Florida State University, through a program for enhancing STEM learning pathways for underrepresented students in Hawaii, and through public outreach products for display at the Birch Aquarium in San Diego.  The study also aims to support an immersive field experience to introduce talented high school students to marine research, with the goal of developing a sustainable marine-related educational program for underrepresented students in rural northwestern Florida.<br/><br/>Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) migrate long distances from high-latitude feeding grounds to spawn exclusively in a small oligotrophic area of the tropical eastern Indian Ocean (IO) that is rich in mesoscale structures, driven by complex currents and seasonally reversing monsoonal winds.  To survive, SBT larvae must feed and grow rapidly under environmental conditions that challenge conventional understanding of food-web structure and functional relationships in poor open-ocean systems.  The preferred prey of SBT larvae, cladocerans and Corycaeidae copepods, are poorly studied and have widely different implications for trophic transfer efficiencies to larvae.  Differences in nitrogen sources - N fixation vs deep nitrate of Pacific origin - to sustain new production in the region also has implications for conditions that may select for prey types (notably cladocerans) that enhance transfer efficiency and growth rates of SBT larvae.  The relative importance of these N sources for the IO ecosystem may affect SBT resiliency to projected increased ocean stratification.  This research expedition investigates how mesoscale variability in new production, food-web structure and trophic fluxes affects feeding and growth conditions for SBT larvae.  Sampling across mesoscale features tests hypothesized relationships linking variability in SBT larval feeding and prey preferences (gut contents), growth rates (otolith analyses) and trophic positions (TP) to the environmental conditions of waters selected by adult spawners.  Trophic Positions of larvae and their prey are determined using Compound-Specific Isotope Analyses of Amino Acids (CSIA-AA).  Lagrangian experiments investigate underlying process rates and relationships through measurements of water-column 14C productivity, N2 fixation, 15NO3- uptake and nitrification; community biomass and composition (flow cytometry, pigments, microscopy, in situ imaging, genetic analyses); and trophic fluxes through micro- and mesozooplankton grazing, remineralization and export.  Biogeochemical and food web elements of the study are linked by CSIA-AA (N source, TP), 15N-constrained budgets and modeling.  The project elements comprise an end-to-end coupled biogeochemistry-trophic study as has not been done previously for any pelagic ecosystem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Important and complex chemical and dynamical processes take place in this region, particularly in the exosphere, where the terrestrial atmosphere literally merges with interplanetary space. Understanding the processes that govern the coupling, energetics, and dynamics of the upper atmosphere requires observations of its mean state and its response to external forcing.  These observations will provide important constraints in developing a complete picture of the space-atmosphere system. Although the terrestrial exosphere is populated by a number of atomic and molecular species, neutral atomic hydrogen is increasingly dominant with altitude and present throughout. The vertical distribution of atomic hydrogen in the upper atmosphere and its vertical transport flux are recognized as important parameters in understanding upper atmospheric chemistry, charge exchange between the ionosphere and neutral atmosphere, and coupling between atmospheric regions. Unfortunately, few direct determinations of these parameters have been achieved. This leaves important questions incompletely answered: What is the distribution of atomic hydrogen in the thermosphere and exosphere? How does that distribution respond to external forcing?

The end-to-end study approach, highlights connections among physical environmental variability, biogeochemistry, and plankton food webs leading to charismatic and economically valuable fish production, is the theme for developing educational tools and modules through the ?scientists-in-the-schools? program of the Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies at Florida State University, through a program for enhancing STEM learning pathways for underrepresented students in Hawaii, and through public outreach products for display at the Birch Aquarium in San Diego.  The study also aims to support an immersive field experience to introduce talented high school students to marine research, with the goal of developing a sustainable marine-related educational program for underrepresented students in rural northwestern Florida.<br/><br/>Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) migrate long distances from high-latitude feeding grounds to spawn exclusively in a small oligotrophic area of the tropical eastern Indian Ocean (IO) that is rich in mesoscale structures, driven by complex currents and seasonally reversing monsoonal winds.  To survive, SBT larvae must feed and grow rapidly under environmental conditions that challenge conventional understanding of food-web structure and functional relationships in poor open-ocean systems.  The preferred prey of SBT larvae, cladocerans and Corycaeidae copepods, are poorly studied and have widely different implications for trophic transfer efficiencies to larvae.  Differences in nitrogen sources - N fixation vs deep nitrate of Pacific origin - to sustain new production in the region also has implications for conditions that may select for prey types (notably cladocerans) that enhance transfer efficiency and growth rates of SBT larvae.  The relative importance of these N sources for the IO ecosystem may affect SBT resiliency to projected increased ocean stratification.  This research expedition investigates how mesoscale variability in new production, food-web structure and trophic fluxes affects feeding and growth conditions for SBT larvae.  Sampling across mesoscale features tests hypothesized relationships linking variability in SBT larval feeding and prey preferences (gut contents), growth rates (otolith analyses) and trophic positions (TP) to the environmental conditions of waters selected by adult spawners.  Trophic Positions of larvae and their prey are determined using Compound-Specific Isotope Analyses of Amino Acids (CSIA-AA).  Lagrangian experiments investigate underlying process rates and relationships through measurements of water-column 14C productivity, N2 fixation, 15NO3- uptake and nitrification; community biomass and composition (flow cytometry, pigments, microscopy, in situ imaging, genetic analyses); and trophic fluxes through micro- and mesozooplankton grazing, remineralization and export.  Biogeochemical and food web elements of the study are linked by CSIA-AA (N source, TP), 15N-constrained budgets and modeling.  The project elements comprise an end-to-end coupled biogeochemistry-trophic study as has not been done previously for any pelagic ecosystem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among the most important and basic climate system components are the heat, freshwater, and carbon content and transport of the oceans, which directly interact with other essential components of the climate system in the atmosphere and cryosphere. In turn the associated variability and trends in the ocean's carbon content, carbonate saturation state, oxygen, and nutrients impact its internal biological environment, with notable large-scale regional changes.  This joint study of the ocean carbon cycle and circulation is critical to identify critical areas where changes in ocean circulation could have serious consequences for future anthropogenic carbon uptake. Global warming-induced changes in the ocean's transport of heat and freshwater, which could affect the circulation, are being followed through these long-term measurements.  Results to date have shown that the abyssal ocean is warming, taking up to 30% of the excess heat in the entire Earth system, leading to changes in circulation patterns and ventilation rates in the upper ocean. The uptake of anthropogenic carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean has been mapped and shows that the oceans are acidifying. Oxygen concentrations are declining in the ocean thermocline, and tropical oxygen minimum zones are expanding. The project is based on the fundamental concept that data collected belong to the community and need to be made quickly and freely available to the community at large through a recognized international data center. The project will continue to promote training and learning for graduate students, postdoctoral scientists, and new scientists in sea-going work. Outreach activities will continue as opportunities arise.<br/><br/>The systematic and global re-occupation of select ocean hydrographic sections conducted for the past decade (2003-2014) will be extended into the 2015-2020 period with the continued objective of quantifying changes in the full-depth ocean. The project is in support of the U.S. CLIVAR (CLImate Variability and predictability) and the Carbon Science Programs, and is a component of a global observing system for the physical climate and carbon system. This long-standing project continues to contribute to the following overlapping scientific objectives: Data for Model Calibration, Validation and Model Based Synthesis; Carbon System Studies; Heat and Freshwater Storage and Flux Studies; Deep and Shallow Water Mass and Ventilation Studies; and Calibration of Autonomous Sensors. By integrating the scientific needs of the carbon, tracer and hydrographic communities, major scientific synergies and cost savings will continue to be achieved. In addition to efficiency, the coordinated approach produces scientific advances that exceed those of having individual programs. An average of two sections will be conducted every year, sometime collaboratively with international partner. The measurements made on each section include hydrography (full-depth vertical profiles of salinity, temperature, oxygen, nutrients, currents), Underway surface temperature, salinity, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), air-sea fluxes, bathymetry, navigation), carbon system (dissolved inorganic carbon, pCO2. Total Alkalinity, pH, dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen), and transient tracers. This project will collect the data and perform the quality control measures routinely carried out by providers of reference-quality data. Post-cruise data updates, distribution, and archive will continue to be managed by groups with separate funding. This ongoing project is integrated with a larger international effort to monitor the ocean's response to climate change."

Impacts from groundwater flooding and evaporation will be most intense on low-lying carbonate islands, where evaporated freshwater is replaced by seawater that percolates through the bedrock. These models incorporate impact of climate and predicted that lakes should remain fresh, and groundwater resources continuous, beneath islands in humid regions. In arid regions, lakes would be hypersaline, and much fresh groundwater would be replaced by seawater.

This paradox between modeled and observed lake salinity underscores our lack of understanding of how groundwater flooding impacts island water resources. During this project, new field data will be collected, and new transient modeling tools will be developed, to test the overarching hypothesis that how groundwater flooding will impact island water resources. We will test the impact of lake area relative to its groundwater contributing area, the degree of connectivity between lakes and the ocean, and dynamic interactions with climate and sea level change on this process. The results of this study should improve predictions of freshwater resource loss of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) from groundwater flooding, perhaps the primary environmental factor triggering their loss of habitability. The modeling tools to be developed as part of this project will be freely distributed to the hydrological community.

The SWAB program has been going on for nearly 35 years as the mechanism for keeping tritium (3H) and radiocarbon (14C) contamination of ships and associated vans and laboratories to a minimum. The SWAB program proposes to continue operations in order to minimize contamination on ships involved in measuring natural abundances of 14C and 3H as part of global ocean programs such as CLIVAR and GEOTRACES. <br/><br/>The University of Miami proposes to serve as an unbiased entity to help ensure that background levels of 14C and 3H can be measured with confidence by the oceanographic community with minimal risk of contamination, while allowing studies and experiments that require the use of these isotopes at elevated levels to continue.  Both 14C and 3H serve as important tracers of ocean circulation and their successful measurement at background levels is crucial to understanding how the oceans affect climate. Recently there has been increased interest in oceanic carbon cycling, and natural abundance measurements of 14C are an important tool for studying the time scales of the carbon cycle. The assurance that these globally important climate-related studies can be carried out advances discovery and understanding, while promoting teaching and learning to a large segment of the oceanographic community. Additionally, the testing for trace levels of radioisotope contamination assures both the ships' crew and science members that adequate steps are being taken to minimize their exposure to radioisotopes.<br/>Broader Impacts:<br/> The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two, providing infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers."

Due to increasing sea levels, storm intensities, and human activities, there is an imperative need to better understand coastal dynamics of flow, sediment transport, and changes in the shape of the coastline and the bottom (morphodynamics).  In the past, there have been some attempts to better understand and predict coastline evolution of sandy beach areas. However, the morphodynamic response of estuary mouths and adjacent beaches to external forces (e.g. waves, tides, river outflows) has received less attention. Nonetheless, inlets play a key role in the wide variety of ecological, economic, and social services associated with estuaries, adjacent beaches, and back-barrier lagoons. The main research goal in this project is to improve the understanding of the processes that lead to sediment movement from the up-drift to down-drift sides of inlets (bypassing). The investigator will analyze the main processes driving the shoreward movement of sand bars over the ebb-tidal delta, how the interactions between tidal and littoral currents affect the alongshore and cross-shore sediment transport, and the morphodynamic effects of infragravity waves. The project will also integrate hands-on experiences to enhance the teaching of coastal morphodynamics. Lessons and educational material will be produced targeting secondary science teachers, and graduate students will be trained and engaged in applying a constructivist approach to learning at the high school level.<br/><br/>Morphodynamics of mixed-energy inlets are still not fully understood due to the complex feedbacks between the highly temporally and spatially varying morphology, waves, tides, river flow, and mixing conditions. One of the key processes in inlet morphodynamics is sediment bypassing. It affects the sediment budget of the inlet and the sand supply to the inner bay, ebb-tidal delta, and adjacent beaches. The most accepted conceptual models of inlet bypassing could benefit from two improvements. First, swash bars over the ebb-tidal delta may not be transported onshore due, primarily, to wave swash. Rather, they should be primarily transported by surfzone currents. Additionally, littoral currents contribute to inlet bypassing not only in wave-dominated inlets, but also in mixed-energy inlets. How tidal and littoral currents interact and affect sediment transport along and across the inlet deserves additional studies. Infragravity waves might also play a primary role in inlet sediment transport processes. This project will combine in situ and remote field observations and numerical modeling at Matanzas Inlet (FL) to analyze, test and integrate these processes to improve our knowledge of sediment transport processes in mixed-energy inlets.  Findings generated from this study will help us better understand the dynamics of these coastal systems and will contribute to the improvement of coastal management tools and procedures. Research and education will be fostered through the involvement of the graduate students in the PI's research group in the educational activities. In collaboration with the Center for Precollegiate Education and Training at the University of Florida, the team will develop and implement four 5E lessons geared towards high-school students and secondary science teachers. This collaboration will provide the graduate students with the opportunity to be trained in the application of the 5E instructional method at the high-school level. A curricular module for a Summer Institute course directed towards secondary science teachers will also be developed as part of this project. The direct interaction with teachers through this collaborative initiative will promote the inclusion of key concepts of coastal morphodynamics (beach, estuaries, and inlets) into the K-12 science curriculum."

This clear sky location is ideally situated for making observations of the highly dynamical environment associated with the mountain waves generated by the surface winds blowing over the Andes. This location is also well suited for detecting sodium particles transported to high altitude by the Appleton fountain effect that operates near the geomagnetic equator. Both of these mechanisms make the Andes dynamical environment a ""hot spot"" that is unique in the world with nothing equivalent available for study in the United States.  ALO is an upper atmosphere observatory that supports optical remote sensing instruments, including a wind/temperature (W&T) lidar operating at the sodium wavelength (589 nm) and several airglow instruments. The lidar system measures simultaneously nighttime atmospheric wave perturbations (associated with gravity waves) of temperature, wind and airglow intensities in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region (80-105 km) at high vertical spatial (<1 km) and temporal resolutions (~1 min) during the low moon period of each month. The MR data provides measurements of the background tidal winds that allow the determination of the intrinsic phase speeds needed for studying gravity wave propagation physics. These results taken together are aimed at achieving a detailed study of atmospheric waves and turbulence structures through modeling comparisons of data with turbulent structure morphology. This project will support engineering undergraduate students at ERAU thus helping to extend the STEM undergraduate education effort at ERAU into the remote sensing area.  One graduate and one undergraduate student would be directly involved in this project. Moreover, these applications made possible by the enhanced quality of the MR data would provide new opportunities for graduate student training in the radar remote sensing technology as well as having these students undertake studies regarding new questions in upper atmosphere research. Students involved will learn the principles of the MR remote sensing technique through the use of formal lectures and informal hands-on interactions. Activities involving the graduate student are site radar noise survey, the process of radar installation and subsequent hardware maintenance. The student would also be responsible for data retrieval, validation and archival processing. The undergraduate student would help set up the Madrigal server and update the ERAU website concerning the meteor radar status. These activities will provide training to these students on how to become an experimental scientist. The MR would also support undergraduate and graduate education at ERAU as the department offers an undergraduate course in Space Physics, one MS level course Experimental Methods in Space Science, and two PhD level courses Upper Atmosphere Physics and Remote Sensing: Active and Passive. Students will learn advanced techniques involved in MR and use the MR data for various course projects. Students can design their own software for meteor identification, wind and temperature retrieval. <br/><br/>The MR measures horizontal wind continuously (day and night) in the same altitude region as the height range observed by the lidar with ~2 km vertical and 1 hr resolutions. It complements the optical lidar measurements by providing background tidal wind information that is critical for deriving gravity wave (GW) intrinsic parameters and understanding the phenomenology of GW wave propagation with regard to reflection, ducting, and dissipation processes. The MR capability for continuous wind measurement is essential for resolving longer time scale oscillations such as atmospheric tides and planetary waves, and for the study of their interactions with small-scale waves. The new MR will not only continue the MR wind measurement series but also provides new capabilities to infer temperature, turbulence diffusion coefficient, and the diurnal variation of GW momentum flux.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Focus by the scientific community is especially important now because of continuing growth of cities, communities, and critical infrastructure within sparsely monitored volcanic fields. Most sub-aerial volcanoes are found in widely distributed volcanic fields made up of tens to hundreds of vents, which comprise a huge range of eruption-styles and landforms ? from scoria cones to calderas ? and which are situated in a variety of tectonic settings. The conference will provide needed background and focus on the problem of distributed, monogenetic volcanism, summarizing current research directions. In the western U.S., widely distributed volcanic fields are virtually unmonitored. Internationally, many cities (e.g., Auckland, Mexico City) are built on geologically active distributed volcanic fields. Great strides have been made in understanding the origins of magmas in these volcanic fields, their large- scale transport across the lithosphere, and statistical models of their eruption have been developed. Yet very fundamental questions remain about this most common style of volcanism. The conference is structured to provide networking activities and related discussions as well as to introduce early career participants to some of the most fascinating volcanic fields in the western U.S. <br/><br/>This AGU Chapman conference on distributed volcanism is structured to encourage interdisciplinary contacts and thinking, in diverse fields such as geochemistry, geophysics, and volcano science. Themes to be address are whether the geophysical monitoring techniques and models (e.g., robust seismic and deformation monitoring) developed to monitor unrest elsewhere will work in volcanic fields. Also, of interest, the conference will touch on how scientists can couple geochemical and geophysical models for magma ascent in small-volume systems. Currently, there is no community consensus on the appropriate response to unrest in volcanic fields and associated hazards, and how these differ from arc composite volcanoes. It is expected that this conference will be of great benefit to early career scientists. It is expected that they will contribute substantially to all phases of the meeting, including giving invited talks, posters, participating in workshop break-out sessions and discussions during the post-meeting field trip to the nearby Springerville volcanic field. Specifically early career scientists will benefit in three ways: (1) at the conference they will participate in discussions and presentations about the cutting-edge science happening to understand volcanic fields, (2) they will learn about collaboration opportunities with USGS colleagues, who are deeply involved in the organization of the meeting, and with international colleagues, (3) they will learn how their disciplinary research fits with other science agendas related to volcanic fields, broadening the scope and impact of their own investigations. The discussions and outcomes of the conference will have direct impact on communities living with distributed volcanism throughout the western U.S. and the world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The variation of this field on the very longest wavelengths describes the elliptical shape of the Earth. This elliptical figure is important because it determines the location of the axis of rotation that passes through the Earth's center and also controls changes in inclination of the Earth relative to the sun, owing to the gravitational 'pull' from the moon, the sun, and other planets. The Earth, in effect, behaves as a spinning top that can oscillate and wobble in complex ways. These changes in axial rotation and inclination affect how much solar energy ('insolation') is received at different latitudes on Earth, especially in the polar regions, and therefore has a major impact on climate and how it changes over long time intervals. A major problem in geophysics is to determine how the elliptical form of the Earth is generated by forces deep inside our planet. These forces also drive the horizontal motions of Earth's tectonic plates and the geological 'drift' of continents, as well as vertically pushing and pulling the continents and oceans up and down over time. Despite more than thirty years of progress by geophysicists who map lateral changes in Earth structure deep inside our planet using seismic waves, and similar progress by computational geophysicists who use these maps to model the internal forces needed to explain the motions of tectonic plates and the 'bumps' in Earth's gravity field, there remains a difficulty in properly accounting for the flattening of the elliptical figure of the Earth that is seen by satellites. The principal investigators (PIs) in this proposal will directly tackle this outstanding challenge by using both earthquake and gravity data, and data describing the topography of the Earth and the movements of tectonic plates, to obtain new maps of Earth's internal structure and new determinations of the forces that can explain all these data simultaneously. The outcome of this work will allow the PIs to specifically tackle the current challenge of accounting for Earth's long-term elliptical figure, how it changes with time, and how it influences high-latitude insolation and hence climate over long times. Powerful computer resources will be deployed to carry out this study over the next three years, employing a collaborative team of researchers from the Universities of Texas and Florida. This work will provide opportunities for training new graduate students who will learn state-of-the-art techniques in computer modelling and will develop advanced expertise in the geophysical sciences. The results of this work will be shared with a broad community of scientists, students and the general public with web-based platforms, communications in conferences and workshop, and in outreach activities.<br/><br/>Key questions regarding the large-scale structure and dynamics of the mantle remain outstanding, despite three decades of progress in global seismic imaging of Earth's interior. There are longstanding difficulties in satisfactorily accounting for the very longest wavelength anomalies in Earth's gravity field, which are related to Earth's elliptical figure, with significant implications for Earth's time-dependent rotational dynamics. Questions concerning heterogeneity in the transition zone and the nature of ""large low shear velocity provinces"" (LLSVP) in the lower mantle, also continue to be elusive. These uncertainties regarding anomalous mantle structures directly impact our understanding of the global-scale dynamics of the Earth. To address the questions, the principal investigators propose a multidisciplinary effort to derive a new generation of tomography models that match a wide suite of surface data related to present-day structure and convective flow in the mantle, and can also constrain the time-dependent evolution of the mantle throughout the Cenozoic. To pursue these objectives the PIs will: (i) jointly invert global seismic and convection-related data with greatly improved coverage of 3-D mantle structure, incorporating geodynamic responses to lateral viscosity variations and topography on the discontinuities at the top and bottom of the transition zone; (ii) apply data assimilation methods to the new joint tomography models to reconstruct the Cenozoic evolution of 3-D mantle structure; (iii) calculate corresponding changes of Earth's moment of inertia, to be used in reconstructions of true polar wander and Milankovitch orbital cycles that are implicated in long-term climate variations. It is anticipated these new joint tomography models will provide improved constraints on the impact of transition-zone heterogeneity on convective mass and heat transport across this key region and on the spatial distribution of anomalous density structures within the LLSVP. This work will also contribute to resolving a longstanding difficulty concerning the origin of Earth's anomalous elliptical figure and the implications for the phase and amplitude of Milankovitch climate cycles in the geological past.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The National Science Foundation is supporting a U.S. GEOTRACES sampling expedition in the Pacific Ocean 2018, from Alaska to Tahiti. This award will focus on measurement of the stable isotopes of iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and cadmium (Cd) in seawater, filtered particles, and atmospheric aerosol particles on this expedition. The trace metals Fe, Ni, Zn, Cu, and Cd strongly influence marine biogeochemistry and carbon cycling. Measurements of isotope ratios -- the relative abundance of different forms of the same chemical element -- provide insights not possible from concentration measurements alone. The investigators will use isotope data to learn more about the inputs and outputs of these elements to the ocean as well as the biological processes that influence their distributions within the oceans, leading to greater understanding of the role these metals play in oceanic carbon cycling. The award will also host an international inter-lab comparison exercise for Cd isotope ratios at low concentrations in seawater. The project will support an early career investigator, a postdoctoral researcher, and undergraduate and graduate students.<br/> <br/>The investigators will measure delta-56Fe, delta-60Ni, delta-65Cu, delta-66Zn, and delta-114Cd at high spatial resolution along the U.S. GEOTRACES Pacific Meridional Transect (PMT). The resulting oceanic sections of all five isotope systems will enable them to distinguish between competing ideas about the controls on trace metal distributions. A wide variety of hypotheses about marine biogeochemical trace metal cycling, addressing topics of global importance will be explored and tested, including: 1) How do different sources, productivity and export regimes, coupled with overturning circulation, control the distribution of Fe, Ni, Zn, Cu and Cd and their isotopes in the Pacific? 2) Do oxygen minimum zones act as sinks for Cd, Zn, Cu and Ni, while acting as sources for Fe? and 3) What sources are most important for supplying Fe to the North Pacific Ocean? The PMT section crosses two high nutrient-low chlorophyll (HNLC) regions and two oligotrophic gyres, as well as transecting the oldest waters in the ocean, allowing the investigators to use high-resolution isotope datasets to investigate competing hypotheses about the effect of vertical, horizontal and in situ biogeochemical processes on the distribution of all five metals and their isotopes. Aerosol dust, volcanogenic and reducing margin sediments, and hydrothermal vents such as the East Pacific Rise have all been hypothesized as major contributors to the dissolved Fe cycle in the Pacific. Measurement of iron isotope signatures in aerosols and near to oceanic sources will enable the identification and quantification the importance of these different iron sources and processes in supplying iron to the iron-limited surface ocean, especially important for the two HNLC regions along the PMT section."

Modeling of atmospheric vertical profiles under various conditions, called single-column model, has been regarded the lowest ""root"" of the hierarchy of model complexity for atmospheric sciences. The goal of this project is to develop and demonstrate the utility of using single-column model platform for understanding and evaluating impacts of various physical parameterization schemes on the tropical climate and variability of a climate model. This project will contribute to relevant international model intercomparison projects, such as the Radiative-Convective Equilibrium Model Intercomparison Project and the Global Atmospheric Systems Study - Weak Temperature Gradient project. The project will support a graduate student to complete his degree and the training of the next generation of atmospheric scientists is also an important impact of this project.<br/><br/>In this project, a PhD student will complete his multi-year work with the PI in devising a version of the Community Atmosphere Model that includes only the vertical interactions among radiation, surface energy exchanges, and turbulence and cloud processes.  Specifically, they will configure the single-column model component of 4 versions of the Community Atmospheric Model in two different settings: one only considers interactions among radiative and convective processes and the other also includes large-scale dynamics effects, although highly idealized or parameterized, in the interaction loops. In the latter case, the large scale would be parameterized using either the weak temperature gradient approximation, or the damped-gravity wave limit.

Whether that covering is grass, trees, pavement, a scattering of small houses, or a densely packed cluster of skyscrapers will affect the wind?s speed, direction, and gustiness.  Such effects can vary from one part of a city to another, even from one side of a building to another.  Experts do not understand such variations as well as they would like.   Computer models used to forecast weather have become more accurate and detailed over the decades but provide little information about how wind speeds and wind gusts vary across city and suburban landscapes. The goal of this project is to use state-of-the-art computer models to learn more about and to improve our ability to predict how buildings disrupt and modify the wind beneath landfalling hurricanes, from just above the ground to near the tops of buildings.  Results will foster better ways to design and locate buildings and other infrastructure near coasts, better ways to forecast hurricane-force winds, better ways to protect lives and property in the face of impending landfall, and better ways to respond immediately afterward.  The project will include 1 graduate student to help provide for the next generation of researchers in this area. <br/><br/>Through computer simulations during the project?s first phase, a range of standard building types in different layouts will be subjected to strikes from archetypal hurricanes.  The simulations will reveal the most important, fundamental physical processes at play on scales that are usually invisible to typical weather forecast models yet are critical to the variation of wind in urban and suburban landscapes.  Armed with the knowledge gained in that first phase, during phase II researchers will then improve the components of the industry-standard Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model that are most directly responsible for predicting wind in developed areas.  Those components were designed to work best for the lower wind speeds typical of most weather, not for hurricane-force winds.  The improved WRF Model from phase II of the project will then be used in phase III to simulate the actual landfall of at least one historical hurricane.  Researchers will retrieve records of the hurricane?s weather observations and wind damage to validate the improved model, evaluating how its representation of hurricane-force winds in urban and suburban areas has been enhanced.  In phase IV, researchers will review more past hurricanes that made landfall in the U.S. and Mexico to select a subset of storms for additional simulations.  Conditions will be perturbed to change the characteristics of those actual storms, generating a collection, often called an ensemble, of synthetic hurricanes that spans a realistically wide range of types.  Finally, in phase V of the project, results from phase IV will be combined with socioeconomic information and mathematical equations for wind damage to create maps of how the vulnerability to high winds in hurricanes varies within the cities selected in phase IV."

MT is sea-level oscillations in the tsunami time scale (minutes to hours) generated by atmosphere perturbations, such as squall lines and frontal passages. MT events are common and documented all over the world. Like tsunami, strong MTs pose a serious threat to human life and coastal infrastructure. The team proposes to conduct a 3-year field experiment to collect unprecedented high-resolution observations off Louisiana (chosen for high MT probability, various bottom friction and existing NOAA and BOEM observations) to fully capture the nonlinear transformation of a MT from generation to its shoreline manifestation. Theoretical analyses and numerical simulations will be combined with the observational data to predict how the MTs transform as they approach shore. The project leverages UK researchers who will collaborate with the team at no cost (being funded by UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under the bilateral agreement). The proposed data collection and the resulting public database will provide a unique source of high-resolution information, leading to an essentially new picture of MT. The new data will produce robust statistics and allow for testing of all future theoretical and numerical developments. Thus, representation of the MT process in numerical models and their ability to predict MT events will be improved. Understanding the MT evolution and improving MT early-warning strategies will protect small fishing vessels and coastal communities. The project will also upgrade the Wave-Current-Surge Information System in the Gulf of Mexico with new high-resolution observation capabilities. Two Ph.D. students will be trained and outreach activities through local K-12 education are planned over the course of the project.<br/>Compared to tsunami, MT evolution is much more nonlinear and more strongly affected by bottom friction. Thus, knowledge acquired in the study of seismic tsunami is not readily transferable to MT research. The events are generated by an atmospheric disturbance that moves at the speed of the oceanic response, which is assumed to propagate as a linear long wave. However, this assumption has not yet been critically tested because of the poor spatial and temporal resolution of available observations. The proposed work is based on the hypothesis that in a generic Proudman-resonated MT event trapped waves are also excited. Although usually less dangerous, they might represent an important part of the process, and behave as precursors to the main wave. The work focuses on the propagation stage of MT: a theoretical description of the nonlinear evolution of both free and trapped components of MT will be developed, including solitary waves, and will be validated for the real topography, and accounting for realistic bottom friction. Data analysis and model development will be integrated into an evaluate-learn-correct cycle that will improve representation of the process and ability to anticipate MT events. Effective numerical models and early-warning strategies could be developed and tested following the findings of this project. Presently, MT early-warning systems mostly rely on interpreting atmospheric data. The new high-resolution observations from this project will be used to incorporate in this cycle elements of real-time ocean response."

These oceanic organisms act as oceanic vacuum cleaners, having incredibly high feeding rates on phytoplankton and, unusual for consumers of their size, smaller bacteria-sized prey.  This rapid feeding and the salps' tendency to form dense blooms, allows them move substantial amounts of prey carbon from the surface into the deep ocean, leading to carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere.  However, salps are often considered a trophic dead-end, rather than a link, in the food web due to the assumption that they themselves are not consumed, since their gelatinous bodies are less nutritious than co-occurring crustacean prey.  Along with this, salp populations are hypothesized to be increasing due to climate change.  This proposal addresses these questions: 1) Do salps compete primarily with crustaceans (as in the prevailing paradigm) or are they competitors of single-celled protists, which are the dominant grazers of small phytoplankton?  2) Do salp blooms increase the efficiency of food-web pathways from tiny phytoplankton to fisheries production in nutrient-poor ocean regions?   <br/><br/>This project will support the interdisciplinary education of a graduate student who will learn modeling and laboratory techniques in the fields of biological and chemical oceanography and stimulate international collaborations between scientists in the United States and New Zealand.  Additionally, several Education and Outreach initiatives are planned, including development of a week-long immersive high school class in biological oceanography, and education modules that will serve the ""scientists-in-the schools"" program in Tallahassee, FL.<br/><br/>It is commonly assumed that salps are a trophic sink.  However, this idea was developed before the discovery that protists (rather than crustaceans) are the dominant grazers in the open ocean and was biased by the difficulty of recognizing gelatinous salps in fish guts.  More recent studies show that salps are found in guts of a diverse group of fish and seabirds and are a readily available prey source when crustacean abundance is low.  This proposal seeks to quantify food web flows through contrasting salp-dominated and salp-absent water parcels near the Chatham Rise off western New Zealand where salp blooms are a predictable phenomenon.  The proposal will leverage previously obtained data on salp abundance, bulk grazing impact, and biogeochemical significance during Lagrangian experiments conducted by New Zealand-based collaborators.  The proposal will determine 1) taxon- and size-specific phytoplankton growth rate measurements, 2) taxon- and size-specific protozoan and salp grazing rate measurements, 3) compound specific isotopic analysis of the amino acids of mesozooplankton to quantify the trophic position of salps, hyperiid amphipods, and other crustaceans, 4) sediment traps to quantify zooplankton carcass sinking rates, and 5) linear inverse ecosystem modeling syntheses.  Secondary production and trophic flows from this well-constrained ecosystem model will be compared to crustacean-dominated and microbial loop-dominated ecosystems in similarly characterized regions (California Current, Costa Rica Dome, and Gulf of Mexico).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Given the severity and urgency of this threat it is critical to investigate mechanisms by which some corals might survive warming, assess the degree to which this is happening on reefs, and apply these discoveries to inform conservation interventions that might improve survival trajectories wherever possible. This project aims to fulfill these objectives by testing whether reef corals in the Caribbean are undergoing shifts in their algal symbionts in favor of more heat-tolerant types, what the consequences of these shifts might be for coral reef ecosystems, and the way in which we might use this information to help conserve them. Scientific objectives will be leveraged to improve the effectiveness of reef restoration efforts in the Caribbean by applying findings to ongoing intervention trials which aim to seed outplanted corals (both adult fragments raised in nurseries, and sexually derived coral recruits) with heat tolerant algae that are climate-resistant. It also takes advantage of emerging opportunities at two major public aquariums to highlight the plight of coral reefs to engaged public audiences primed to receive this message and learn about the role of science in both understanding and mitigating the problem. Finally, numerous high school, undergraduate, and graduate students will receive mentorship during this project, helping to train the next generation of marine scientists. <br/><br/>This project tests whether continued climate warming is causing heat-tolerant algal symbionts (such as Durusdinium trenchii) to become increasingly common on coral reefs in the Caribbean.

This project will: (1) Manipulate coral symbioses in the laboratory, including a number of Caribbean coral species never before attempted, to assess in a standardized way their relative ability to acquire heat-tolerant symbionts; (2) Outplant corals with manipulated symbiont communities to reefs to assess real-world ecophysiological tradeoffs to heat tolerance, such as reduced growth rate; (3) Introduce heat-tolerant symbionts to coral colonies in the field using tissue implants in order to understand environmental controls on the persistence or loss of introduced symbionts; (4) Evaluate transgenerational feedbacks in the symbiotic milieu by investigating the roles of temperature and D. trenchii availability on the acquisition and establishment of these symbionts in newly settled coral larvae; and (5) Quantify changes in the incidence and relative abundance of heat-tolerant symbionts in the Caribbean over the last ~20 years using unique archived samples dating back to 1995-2002 from Florida, Bahamas, Belize, and Bermuda.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
