Cumulus parameterization is a critical component in global climate prediction. The ultimate goal of the study is to improve cumulus parameterization using a physically based, time-variant convective updraft core concept. The close collaborations between the PI and Co-PI will add new research field (atmospheric sciences) and strengthen the current research and teaching (computer sciences) at Morgan State University, an HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities) that has been recently designated as Maryland's preeminent public urban research university. An education component is built into the study, where a graduate student and an undergraduate student will be supported and trained in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) field at Morgan State University.<br/><br/>Coherent updraft cores are the engine for convective heat and moisture transport. However, systematic study of convective updraft cores from a Lagrangian point of view has not been performed before. This project will take advantages of existing computer image recognition and machine learning algorithms, adapt them to high resolution cloud-resolving model simulations, in order to automatically identify updraft core features and track them throughout their full life cycle. Three sets of progressively more sophisticated simulations will be carried out: ensemble simulations of triggered single convection, quasi-equilibrium state simulation, and case studies using observed large-scale forcing. Convective updraft core characteristics such as their sizes, depths, lifespan and spatial distributions will be derived from these simulations. Model sensitivity tests that perturb environmental conditions, e.g., stability, water vapor, wind shear, will reveal environmental controls on updraft core characteristics. <br/><br/>Convection organization will also be studied in the context of updraft cores through their congregation, merging and splitting.  Although not immediately achievable in the framework of current project, the ultimate goal is to use the time-variant convective core concept established in this study to improve cumulus parameterization in global climate predictions. A database including thousands of convective updraft cores and their lifecycles will be compiled and made public through this project for further study.<br/><br/>This is an interdisciplinary study that takes advantage of existing data mining and machine learning algorithms in information sciences and applies them to 3D wind fields where convection is embedded. Identifying and tracking updraft cores is a novel approach that will provide new insights to dynamics and physics of moist convection and its organization. The time-dependent updraft core concept can potentially be used to replace the steady state plume model in current GCM cumulus parameterizations, allowing for a scale-independent cumulus parameterization with a physical underlying concept.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Simulations consist of discretizing and integrating the partial differential equations governing fluid flow and transport forward in time, providing solutions for physical variables (fields such as velocity and pressure) as function of time and space in the entire domain of interest. Since such simulations generate enormous amounts of data, the prevailing approach has been for researchers to analyze the data ""on the fly"" during the simulation runs while only a small subset of time-steps are stored for subsequent analysis. As a result, often large simulations of the same process must be repeated after new questions arise that were not initially obvious. Many (or even most) breakthrough concepts cannot be anticipated in advance, as they will be motivated in part by output data and must then be tested against it. As a result, there is a need for methods to store entire space-time data from such simulations.  This project develops innovative tools for the efficient creation of open numerical databases that contain massive outputs from computational fluid dynamics simulations used in turbulence research and geophysical transport modeling and makes these available to the entire community. Several of the datasets to be included into the Open Numerical Laboratory will be contributed by external researchers. In addition to enhancing engineering and geophysical fluid mechanics and turbulence research, democratized access to large-scale turbulent flow simulation data will also play a crucial role in education and training for the next generation of researchers. Active learning through new educational modules that allow students to query simulation datasets in unprecedented detail will provide new educational paradigms. More broadly, the lessons learned from this project will be generalizable to many other fields where numerical simulations generate very large datasets that are difficult to access using prevailing approaches. In this way, the project will enhance the scientific and broader impacts of the US high-performance scientific computing infrastructure. <br/><br/>This project will develop innovative tools for the efficient creation of open numerical databases that contain massive outputs from computational fluid dynamics simulations used in turbulence research and geophysical transport modeling. An ingest pipeline to be developed will enable users to transfer data from file systems containing the output of their massive direct numerical simulations, build a database, and serve it to the community for open exploratory data analysis and innovative turbulence and oceanic mixing research. To date, the investigators involved in this project have built an Open Numerical Laboratory focusing on direct numerical simulations (DNS) of canonical turbulent flows, in which the entire space-time data are available to the wider research community. However, the existing datasets are few in number and databases have been created one by one, using methodologies difficult to replicate on a massive scale.  Moreover, emerging Exascale simulations will potentially result in data sets of unprecedented scale (tens to hundreds of PetaBytes). Advanced computer science algorithms will be required to tackle these challenges. This project will (a) develop automated, and scalable data management algorithms to ingest, index and serve very large data sets generated by a wide range of groups, (b) explore novel algorithms using spatio-temporal subsampling combined with online interpolation with re-simulation, yielding large compression factors depending on the subsampling stride, and (c) use machine learning algorithms to identify localized regions of interest in the simulations and save these 4D domains in a database for detailed follow-up analytics. The new databases will include data from (1) the largest channel flow DNS, (2) rotating and stratified turbulence of geophysical interest, (3) a DNS of developing wall boundary layer and (4) detailed ocean circulation models with complex boundary conditions. As part of the innovative domain science applications, data sets will be used to improve turbulence models using data-assimilation concepts, study Lagrangian vortex dynamics, and explore geophysical transport in a regional general circulation model of the North Atlantic Ocean."

The resulting variability and disturbed conditions leads to harmful impacts on technological systems and even to risk to humans. Scientific imperatives and practical concerns converge in making space weather a rising priority for society and national planners. This collaborative project provides support for a consortium of four U.S. universities to continue the operations of a suite of High Frequency coherent-backscatter radars within the NSF Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS). This extension will enable a broad range of research across the space science community. The U.S. consortium functions as part of the international Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) which encompasses more than 35 radars distributed from mid through high to polar latitudes in both the northern and southern hemispheres. The leveraged benefits of the activities include student participation in the engineering and scientific tasks required to operate the network and to achieve the desired data products.<br/><br/>SuperDARN is well known for producing maps of the large-scale circulation of ionospheric plasma that can be compared in terms of scientific significance and practical utility to maps of winds and pressure systems in tropospheric weather. The radars observe a wide range of effects in the coupled magnetosphere-ionosphere thermosphere system that bear directly on understanding and modeling space weather events. The award will continue a program of continued observations while also achieving significant refurbishment of eleven U.S. radars located in North America and add the operations of two new radars in Iceland that are being built on separate support. It will also enable, with partial funding and by virtue of the availability of data, a broad range of research by the U.S. SuperDARN scientists on such new themes as convection in the inner magnetosphere, subauroral ionospheric convection, and solar flare impacts on the ionosphere. As a consequence of this award, the U.S. research community will be supplied with data from the entire set of SuperDARN radars and assisted in the application of SuperDARN data and data products. The award will provide new data products to the community include mapping of ionospheric plasma convection at much improved spatial resolution and techniques for applying machine learning to geospace datasets. In coordination with international collaborators simplified methods for data access will be developed that meet the emerging requirements by agencies and journals to make data discoverable and interoperable.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In contrast, ""flash droughts"" intensify dramatically in just a few weeks. A number of these events have struck the United States in recent years, leading to significant and unexpected damage to agriculture and the economy. Flash droughts are poorly represented in current forecast systems, hindering drought preparedness. This project is motivated by the need to advance understanding of flash droughts in order to improve our ability to predict them. To do this, we will focus on the critical role that plants play in the development of a flash drought. New satellite technologies and field measurement methods make it possible to detect water stress in plants weeks before that stress can be seen by eye. When plant stress increases rapidly there is a high risk of flash drought. Using this understanding, we will produce flash drought definitions and detection systems that cover the entire contiguous United States. We will then categorize flash droughts according to the ways in which weather and vegetation interact to cause the drought. These interactions can be very different for different regions or land uses, so identifying categories is an important step for improving prediction. Using these categories, we will apply recently developed statistical methods to combine plant stress observations with weather forecasts to predict flash drought risk from two weeks to three months in advance. Predictions at these time scales can inform planting decisions and relief efforts. Finally, highly damaging flash droughts will be selected for detailed study using advanced weather models, in order to understand how land management and climate contribute to particularly severe events.<br/><br/>This project will advance flash drought understanding and forecasting by targeting three known characteristics: (1) observations of vegetation and soil moisture can provide early indications of flash drought risk at significant lead times; (2) evaporative demand is a leading driver of flash drought onset, and it is amenable to skillful subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasts; (3) vegetation plays a central role in flash drought development via soil moisture and turbulent heat fluxes. To leverage these features for prediction, we propose a new framework for defining flash droughts based on the understanding that a rapid increase in vegetation stress is the core defining flash drought characteristic. This framework makes use of advanced satellite and ground observations. We will classify historic flash drought events across the Contiguous United States on the basis of meteorological, hydrological, and ecological factors, allowing us to distinguish different types of event that have distinct processes and predictability characteristics. This classification will support probabilistic statistical and machine learning forecast models that combine information from recently developed observation datasets and global S2S forecasting systems. Analysis of drought classes and predictability will, in turn, be used to select cases for detailed dynamically-based simulation studies that isolate the role of vegetation and its contribution to predictability. Finally, the simulation infrastructure established during the project will be used to examine climate and land cover sensitivities of flash droughts, contributing to projections of future flash drought risk and assessment of land management options. Taken together, these activities will bring new tools to flash drought prediction, contribute to dynamically-based simulation of drought, and place both understanding and prediction of these extreme events into the broader context of climate trends and the terrestrial carbon balance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Earth radiates 46 terawatts (46 million millon watts) to space, and this power emission reflects contributions from primordial and radiogenic sources, with the former constituting planetary accretion and core-formation sources. Inside the Earth, the decay of 3 radioactive elements (potassium, thorium, and uranium) produces 99% of the Earth?s nuclear power. Existing measurements of the Earth's flux of geoneutrinos, electron antineutrinos from terrestrial natural radioactivity, reveal the amount of uranium and thorium in the Earth, but these data come with considerable uncertainty. Given the understanding of the amount and distribution of these elements in the continental crust, it is known that they contribute about 7 TW of radiogenic power to the continental heat flux, and this component plus an underlying mantle flux accounts for about 1/3 of the total power lost from the Earth. The remaining 2/3 of the Earth's surface heat flux comes up beneath the oceans, but it is not known how much of this mantle flux is primordial versus radiogenic contributions. Compositional models of the Earth collectively allow for up to a factor of 30 in estimates of the mantle's radiogenic power. The understanding of the Earth's thermal evolutionary history is intimately linked to knowing the total radiogenic power of the mantle. Consequently, this project seeks to understand the rate and magnitude by which the planet is cooling. Thus, by determining the amount of radioactive energy that powers the Earth's engine, one can make a 'fuel gauge' that identifies the proportion of primordial to radioactive fuel left in the planet. In addition, there will be collaboration with particle physicists and members of the U.S. intelligence community in the detection of electron antineutrinos (from nuclear reactors and the Earth) for nuclear nonproliferation purposes. Reactor antineutrinos are the background for the analyses of geoneutrino research and geoneutrinos are the background for reactor monitoring.<br/><br/>Despite best efforts there remains an order of magnitude uncertainty in the amount of radiogenic power driving mantle dynamics, given the competing models of the Earth's composition. Direct measurements of the abundance of radiogenic, heat-producing elements (K, Th and U) present in the mantle and much of the deep continental crust do not exist. Importantly, this picture is rapidly changing because of new, larger and more sensitive geoneutrino detectors that are coming on line in the coming years. In the next 8 years, a suite of 5 experiments will define the mantle's radiogenic contribution to the surface heat loss and when tested to a reference model these data can define the radiogenic heat from the mantle. These results will fix limits on the composition of the silicate Earth and will set bounds on permissible values for models defining the mode of mantle convection.The abundance and distribution of the heat-producing elements in the Earth will be studied, and the major tasks include: 1) Improve predictions and reduce systematic errors in defining the regional geoneutrino signal to SNO+ detector (Ontario, Canada), 2) Model geological, geochemical, and geophysical data of the regional lithologies surrounding the KamLAND, JUNO (Guangzhou, China) and Jinping (Sichuan, China) detectors to improve geological predictions, 3) Develop and improve the global reference model at the 1x1 degree scale, making it a community resource that goes beyond applications in geoneutrino studies, 4) Test existing and future data from all detectors against estimates of the regional and global contribution, assuming all detectors see approximately the same mantle signal (within +/-10%), and 5) Use above data to test models of the bulk silicate Earth. Data from current and planned detectors can bring resolution to several major issues in Earth sciences, such as 1) what are the building blocks used to make the planet; 2) what is the present-day proportion of radiogenic heat relative to the residual heat of accretion, core formation and extinct nuclides; 3) what is the present-day fraction of radiogenic heat in the continental crust relative to that in the mantle; and 4) what is the composition of the silicate Earth, upper mantle, and lower mantle? Answers to these questions will, in turn, define  the power that is driving plate tectonics, mantle convection and the geodynamo, as well as the structure of mantle convection. Neutrino geoscience offers a great potential to address these broad interdisciplinary issues."

While research universities are likely to offer such opportunities to undergraduate students, non-research colleges and universities usually have limited ability to provide science projects for their students. To address this need, we propose to develop an educational center that will serve students at two non-research institutions in Puerto Rico. Through the center we will link students with researchers who will guide them in conducting research in Puerto Rico?s coastal lagoons. Hispanic students will be involved in a variety of activities during the summer and academic year focusing on experiential learning in the geosciences. Students will gain research experience and exposure to marine science professionals through networking, internships, and travel to national meetings. The students will also participate in geosciences professional development activities (e.g. personal statement writing, science communication, oral presentations, etc.). The center will foster partnerships among research and non-research institutions and government and non-profit institutions interested in building a sustainable and effective education center focused on Puerto Rico?s coastal lagoons. The project includes a diverse interdisciplinary team of scientists and educators from both the mainland United States and Puerto Rico. The team and center are committed to increasing marine science learning opportunities for underrepresented and underserved students. <br/><br/>II Technical<br/>In an effort to close the opportunity gap and enhance STEM retention for underrepresented groups at primarily non-research colleges and universities, we will establish the Tropical Oceanography Research Training for Undergraduate Academics (TORTUGA) Center to introduce early- through advanced-stage undergraduate students from Puerto Rico to geoscience education and research. This center will link research and non-research institutions to strengthen research capacity and establish educational programs to teach research skills to undergraduates in STEM fields. Specific goals of the TORTUGA Center are to: 1) build sustainable multidisciplinary education and experiential learning programs focused on coastal science problems and solutions; 2) increase access for underrepresented students to watershed, coastal, and marine science education; 3) develop institutional structures to assist students at critical educational junctures, increase student retention in STEM fields, and encourage pursuit of geoscience careers; and 4) adapt this model and strengthen its long-term sustainability. To do this we will: 1) strengthen and expand existing cross-institutional partnerships and team science research programs we have developed over the past five years through a series of pilot projects; 2) provide research opportunities at minority-serving institutions in Puerto Rico for coastal and watershed geoscience research; and 3) evaluate and assess our educational practice model in light of our program goals and current educational pedagogy research. An anticipated outcome of this project is a set of best practices for increasing STEM retention in primarily non-research institutions serving underrepresented groups, focused largely on Puerto Rican and Hispanic populations but applicable to a broad spectrum of undergraduate experiences."

The ionosphere affects modern technologies such as civilian and military communications and navigation and surveillance systems.  Reliable communication and navigation, therefore, often requires correction of the signals for effects imposed by the ionosphere. To do that the properties of the ionosphere, such as its variability with respect to magnetospheric disturbance, time of day, season of the year, and solar cycle variability must be well understood and modeled.     The fundamental measurements of IT-SPINS are high-sensitivity line-of-sight observations of Ultra Violet nightglow radiance produced by the recombination of Oxygen ions with electrons in the upper ionosphere.   IT-SPINS will rotate at two rotations per minute about the orbit normal and will acquire 60 radiance measurements per revolution.  Observations from several rotations will then be combined in a tomographic inversion algorithm to produce two-dimensional altitude/in-track images of the emissions.   In this way, IT-SPINS will provide the first-ever set of unambiguous, geographically-extended measurements of the Oxygen ion distributions within the nightside ionosphere.  Specifically, IT-SPINS will provide crucial information on the ion gradient structures in the, so-called, Topside Transition Region, from approximately 500km to 1000km altitude, where a transition takes place in the plasma conditions from being dominated by Oxygen ions to being dominated by Hydrogen ions. Prior studies of the TTR have primarily used large incoherent scatter radars at only a few locations around the World. Consequently, a thorough climatological study of the TTR's dependence on latitude, local time, and solar and geomagnetic activity does not exist at present. Lacking fundamental understanding of the variability of the TTR and the detailed morphology of Oxygen ion distributions throughout the TTR is a critical limitation currently in our ability to accurately model and predict ionospheric variability.   <br/><br/>Beyond fundamental space weather objectives, the IT-SPINS project places a significant priority on experimental learning in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education at the university undergraduate level. Undergraduate students will participate in responsible roles on all aspects of the project.  This provides the students with rare and valuable opportunities to learn and practice project management; systems engineering; engineering design, development and testing; and flight operations and data analysis skills through first-hand, project-based learning while being mentored by faculty and professional staff. In addition, through affiliation with the statewide Montana Space Grant Consortium (MSGC), the project will engage traditionally disadvantaged students at MSGC affiliated Tribal Colleges with IT-SPINS operational activities during the orbital phase.  <br/><br/>IT-SPINS can achieve compelling science results over a wide range of available orbit inclinations (>40 degrees) and altitudes (500-700 km). This altitude range puts us at optimal viewing of the TTR above, and plasma structures below the satellite while ensuring a 25-year de-orbit criteria. The following primary and secondary science objectives and derived science questions are designed so that a subset of them can be addressed by IT-SPINS regardless of the satellite orbit it will be given. The primary science objective for the mission is to study the variability of the TTR and O+ altitude profiles.  The following three questions will be addressed: 1) How does the altitude and thickness of the boundary between O+ dominated ionospheric physics and H+, He+ dominated plasmasphere physics vary as a function of magnetic L-shell, magnetic longitude, local time and geomagnetic activity?  2) How well do Geospace numerical models predict the observed variability of the TTR and O+ altitude profiles? 3) What is the importance of the charge exchange between O+ and neutral hydrogen to the TTR?   Imaging the mesoscale structuring of equatorial plasma bubbles and polar cap patches constitutes a secondary science objective for the mission. The equatorial part of the secondary science objective can be addressed by both mid- and high inclination orbits, whereas the polar patch part can only be addressed for high inclination orbits (~70 degrees or higher)."

However, like many estuaries on developed coasts, the MCBs are experiencing degraded water quality, potentially due to changes in exchange at the inlets. Interactions between the bay and ocean through inlets are highly complex owing to feedbacks between tidal and subtidal processes and bathymetry. Waves can significantly alter these inlet dynamics by driving changes to local (inside the inlet) and far-field (inside the bay) water levels, currents, and exchange, particularly during storms, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. In addition, although there are two respected methods for estimating wave forcing in a numerical model, there are few instances of comparisons with field observations inside the inlet channels to determine the merits and limitations of these methods. This study utilizes an existing three-dimensional numerical model developed for the MCBs, along with existing field observations from U. S. Army Corps of Engineers and new field observations, to: (1) field-test and improve numerical parameterizations of wave forcing in the model and (2) use the observations and field-tested simulations to study (a) wave effects on water levels, currents, and water and salt exchange through an inlet depend on inlet characteristics (i.e., shoal morphology, channel depth and orientation relative to wave direction), and (b) wind and storm driven modulations of wave effects at the inlet mouth, within the lagoon, and in the case of a two-inlet system at the second inlet. In 2014, only 23% of B.S. degrees in Earth/Atmospheric/Ocean Sciences were awarded to non-white students (2% to African-American students). This project will help expand that small, but valuable, pool of minority students in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields, by supporting a physical oceanography numerical modeling laboratory within a Historically Black College/University (HBCU) and by providing opportunities for undergraduate students and graduate students at an HBCU to integrate research with their education through inquiry-based learning. The study is in collaboration with the US Naval Academy (USNA) and it will provide an avenue for a non-HBCU (USNA) to learn from an HBCU ways to improve minority retention and promote an inclusive culture in STEM education. Results from the proposed study will be presented at academic conferences as well as to local stakeholders and in public outreach events and the scientific finding will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals.<br/><br/>Although the study will focus on the MCBs, this project is expected to benefit the broader field of physical oceanography by developing field-tested parameterizations for the modeling of wave effects and by expanding knowledge of wave effects to a new range of geometric scales and physical conditions. For decades, scientists have debated the merits and limitations of wave-current theories, with little consensus; field-testing these theories will provide valuable insight into these discussions. In addition, wave effects on the dynamics in a multiple-inlet system like the MCBs have received little attention; this study will broaden understanding of wave effects to new geometries. Feedbacks between waves and subtidal processes will also be examined to quantify the change in overall storm effects, depending on the combination of forcings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is increasing undergraduate geoscience major recruitment through three mechanisms: 1) through partnerships with regional high schools and community colleges, and 2) through introductory geoscience classes by increased use of hands-on, active learning practices, and 3) through improved publicity about geoscience career opportunities, including teaching at the K-12 level. This project is improving retention through 1) academic advising at a program level to reduce barriers and foster learning communities, 2) developing peer networks, and 3) building of connections between Towson University (TU) geoscience students and the broader geosciences community. Cohorts of undergraduates engaged in faculty-mentored research serve as a core around which the geoscience programs at TU are being strengthened and grown. The cohort experience serves as a major tool to recruit and then retain students to geoscience majors. Undergraduate research experiences have been demonstrated to improve academic outcomes, interest in graduate school, and the percentage of students working in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM)-related careers. An increase in the number and diversity of students entering geoscience careers will help meet workforce demands for the U.S. economy. <br/><br/>This project builds on existing best-practice methods for recruitment, student engagement, and professional development to increase the number and diversity of students entering geoscience careers. Faculty from TU and partnering 2-year community colleges (2YCs) and high schools are working together to publicize geoscience majors and career opportunities to increase recruiting into TU geoscience majors. TU and 2YC faculty also are seeking to establish transfer pathways into TU geoscience majors, since 42% of current incoming TU students enter as transfer students. Evaluation of the results of these approaches is advancing knowledge of methods to broaden pipelines for geoscience students transferring from 2YCs to four-year institutions and serves to inform other institutions working on these transitions. Qualitative research of student experiences offers insights into which best-practice methods are most effective and why. This project will contribute to the relatively thin literature on extracurricular geoscience research experiences for students. By the end of the project, at least 18 students will be affected directly through the research cohorts.  In addition, tens of students per academic year will be reached through the field trips and >500 students per year will be reached through recruiting efforts and pedagogical reform of introductory geoscience courses. Smoothing pathways from 2YCs to TU for transfer students will reduce the time students spend in college and the financial costs they incur, including students pursuing secondary teaching certification in Earth-Space Science. Underrepresented group participation in TU geoscience programs will be increased through recruitment from 2YCs with a higher percentage of minority students than TU and through the selection process of the cohort program, where consideration will be given to diversity and academic performance."

The high collision rate between the Philippine Sea Plate and the Eurasian Plate has built up a series of hills and mountains called a fold-and-thrust belt in western Taiwan. There have been at least 10 powerful earthquakes in this belt in the last 100 years. Every year, more than 1.6 inches of plate shortening is accommodated by this fold-and-thrust belt, making western Taiwan an ideal natural laboratory for understanding how mountains are built and earthquakes are generated. This three-year proposal supports two tenure-track early career faculty members and a female graduate student to broaden diversity in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Some of the products can be integrated into an outreach package for the Maryland Day open house event. This package is designed for the general public for learning active plate tectonics, earthquake cycles, and natural hazard in different tectonic environments. Additionally, this project promotes collaboration between several institutions in the US and Taiwan. The analyses and results of this work are directly relevant to seismic hazard assessment in western Taiwan.<br/> <br/>The team is merging geodetic and seismologic measurements in order to answer scientific questions such as: (1) What are the characteristics of surface deformation in the fold-and-thrust belt in Taiwan? (2) Is the orientation of the principal crustal shortening consistent at different depths in a fold-and-thrust belt? (3) Can we use seismology, geodesy, and numerical modeling to identify active faults and calculate slip budget in different parts of the fold-and-thrust belts in western Taiwan? The team uses more than 15 years of continuous Global Navigation Satellite Systems (cGNSS) and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) displacement in order to estimate three-dimensional surface deformation with about hundred-feet spatial resolution in the Western Foothills in Taiwan. They also take advantage of the high-resolution seismic data from the Taiwanese seismic catalog to compare with GNSS and InSAR measurements. With these measurements combined, they can comprehensively analyze tectonic stress at different depths and investigate how aseismic and seismic fault motions with depth in an active fold-and-thrust belt. These joint surface deformation and crustal stress analyses bring further insights into the behavior of tectonic stress near the main detachment of a fold-and-thrust belt, and characterize earthquake potential below the main detachment.<br/><br/>Funding to support this project is provided by the EAR Tectonics and EAR Geophysics Programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many important decisions that influence FEWS nexus issues are made by regional decision makers. However, regional FEWS planning is also shaped by national and global dynamics, including socioeconomic and technological changes, international trade dynamics, climate change, and national efforts to address societal priorities such as economic growth and sustainable development goals (SDGs). The ability of nations to achieve these broader societal goals is, in turn, strongly influenced by regional decisions. This project develops a new, integrated analytical approach that considers the interconnections among food, energy, and water systems to improve regional FEWS planning. The research ensures consistency of regional planning scenarios with national and global trends, while also considering institutional barriers to integrated planning. This project focuses on integrated FEWS planning in river basins in Argentina and Uruguay. These locations are ideal testbeds for developing this new approach due to their strong regional-to-global connectivity through agricultural trade, diversity in institutional structures, and mix of far-reaching policies, from SDGs to climate adaptation. This research will directly benefit U.S. national interests, as sustainable development in Latin America promotes stability in international markets for agricultural and energy goods. Three primary science questions guide the research: (1) What analytical methods can be applied at regional scale to not only couple among FEW systems but also to broader national and global dynamics in a manner that is computationally efficient, data efficient, and decision-relevant? (2) What institutional barriers limit the adoption of FEW systems planning at a regional scale and how can analytical tools be designed and integrated into institutional processes to overcome those barriers? (3) How can uncertainties affecting regional the FEW systems decision-making processes be most effectively characterized and visualized to improve the robustness of FEW systems planning? Generalizable insights and analytical toolkits developed in answering these questions will promote more robust and sustainable economic growth internationally and in the United States, and will be transferable to other locations, including the United States.<br/> <br/>The overarching goal of this research is to design and use models to break down institutional barriers and facilitate joint institutional decision making across the food, energy, and water sectors. The project will contribute three science advances that facilitate adoption of the integrated regional planning approaches required to coordinate development activities across scales and sectors. (1) The project will contribute a modeling platform that can effectively couple sub-regional FEW systems together at the regional level and connect them to national and global socioeconomic and climatic forces in an internally consistent, computationally efficient, and decision-relevant manner to allow for comprehensive scenario exploration and uncertainty analysis. (2) The project will identify the institutional barriers to infusing nexus thinking in regional FEW systems planning by applying innovative institutional mapping and stakeholder engagement techniques to co-develop decision-relevant modeling advances. (3) The project will enhance the decision relevance of regional FEW systems modeling and planning scenarios by characterizing key uncertainties and aiding stakeholders in identifying and visualizing planning strategies that are robust to a wide array of future uncertainties. The institutional mapping in (2) will inform the nexus model construction in (1), and the efficient nexus model from (1) will be used to identify key dynamics and challenges to robustness in (3), which will be communicated via efficient visual analytics to in-country stakeholders in (2). Uruguay and Argentina will serve as learning laboratories to empirically explore these three advances because, despite their shared FEW systems challenges, the two countries differ with respect to key institutional, economic, climatic, and policy factors. These differences will allow alternative hypotheses to be tested regarding how best to design and use models to break down institutional barriers and facilitate joint institutional decision making in real-world contexts, as well as to demonstrate the transferability and generalizability of methodological advances.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The 2013 National Research Council Decadal Survey for Solar and Space Physics identifies collisionless shocks as a universal process that facilitates the transition from supersonic to subsonic flow, heats the plasma, and accelerates energetic particles.  Planetary bow shocks provide a route to converting the supersonic and super-Alfvenic solar wind bulk kinetic energy into other forms of energy: plasma heat, particle acceleration, and electromagnetic energy.  The Earth?s bow shock in particular has been a treasure trove of data on the means by which collisionless shocks energize the plasma, with an increased flurry of study in recent years due to the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) Mission.  During this 2-year Postdoctoral Research Fellowship (PRF) project, the PI will utilize in-situ data of bow shock crossings from the MMS to study collisionless shocks.  Recently developed diagnostics, such as the field-particle correlation, when applied to the distribution function data from MMS, will allow the PI to confirm directly the presence of resonant energization processes in magnetosheath turbulence.  He will deploy the field-particle correlation on simulations inspired by recent MMS bow-shock crossings.  The PI will determine the energization processes present in these collisionless shocks by utilizing the continuum Vlasov-Maxwell solver developed by him, which provides a much higher fidelity representation of the distribution function compared to traditional particle-based methods.  The research work will comprise continuum kinetic simulations, which would provide unprecedented resolution of the particle distribution function, thus allowing careful diagnosis of the kinetic processes present in the collisionless shocks.  Using the results of the simulations as a ?Rosetta Stone,? the PI will apply the field-particle correlation to the corresponding MMS data, and completely characterize the energetics of the plasma in these bow-shock crossings.  During the project, alongside the research investigations, the PI will continue to serve as a steward of science, using his previous outreach and leadership experience.  He will volunteer for the Hawkeyes in Space and Science programs at the University of Iowa and participate in the public outreach events organized by the programs. Likewise, he will work with fellow junior scientists in the American Physical Society?s Division of Plasma Physics (APS DPP) to grow and develop new programs aimed at students and early career scientists, such as the Student Day and Dissertation Talks.  <br/><br/>Despite the large volume of data coming out of space missions like the MMS, and complementary kinetic simulations, our understanding of the evolution of a collisionless shock as a function of Mach number and shock geometry, i.e., the angle between the shock normal and upstream magnetic field, remains incomplete.  Kinetic instabilities upstream of the shock launched by reflected particles and wave-particle interactions in the plane perpendicular to the shock significantly complicate the energy transfer.  The primary aim of this 2-year PRF project is to leverage cutting edge techniques for numerically integrating the kinetic equation, as well as novel diagnostics, to illuminate the energy conversion mechanisms of a collisionless shock.  The project addresses questions of fundamental importance to the Solar-Terrestrial Research program, such as ?processes by which energy is generated by the Sun, transported to the Earth, and ultimately deposited in the terrestrial environment.?  The research and EPO agenda of this PRF project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The related research is ongoing, and most models rely on macroscopic (fluid) models of the solar wind.  When kinetic effects, such as wave-particle interaction, are considered, however, the approach is usually not self-consistent in that certain types of wave turbulence is presupposed, and the wave spectra are modeled.  In contrast, the theoretical model to be developed as part of this three-year project will be fully kinetic and self-consistent.  This will significantly advance the knowledge in the field of heliospheric physics.  The model to be developed as part of this project will predict a particular state in which the solar wind plasma exists given a set of parameters, allowing the observed quantities to be tested against historic spacecraft data as well the planned measurements of the near-Sun environment that will be obtained by the Parker Solar Probe.  Although the present project is a theoretical one, rather than one involving data analysis, the resulting prediction may help experimentalists better interpret the past and future spacecraft data.  This has the potential to advance knowledge in a related, but different field of expertise, namely experimental heliophysics.<br/><br/>This three-year research project will investigate theoretically how the kinetic coupling of electrons and ions (protons) via collisional and instability processes affect the large-scale dynamics in the expanding solar wind.  The specific problem to be investigated relates to how the dynamically coupled solar wind electrons and protons contribute to the near isotropization of their temperatures -- an observed phenomena which has not yet been satisfactorily explained theoretically.  The PI's preliminary work based upon the assumption of bi-Maxwellian particle distribution shows that collisional process may be the dominant mechanism for the isotropization of temperatures, but the instabilities are important too for limiting the upper/lower bounds of temperature anisotropies. This project aims to extend the preliminary work by relaxing the assumption of bi-Maxwellian model in both instability analysis and collisional transport calculation.  The full kinetic equations for particles and waves, as well as the dispersion relation, will be solved by grid-based numerical scheme.  The collisional transport equation will also be solved by relaxing the assumption of bi-Maxwellian models.  Finally, the effects of inhomogeneities will be rigorously investigated by solving the macro-microscopic kinetic equation.<br/><br/>The research on the theoretical modeling of the solar wind is important from the broader perspective of understanding and characterizing fundamental processes that take place within the heliosphere and throughout the universe.  Discovering and understanding the basic physical processes in the immediate near-Earth environment and in the wider universe is essential for future human explorations of the universe, and it also has a space environmental impact, as the modern civilization is increasingly dependent on electromagnetic conditions in outer space.  Developing an accurate model of the solar wind contributes to such a wider goal. From the perspective of education and training, the present proposal involves a young post-doctoral research associate, which is a major strength in terms of Broader Impacts.  It is important for the healthy scientific future of our nation -- and the entire human society -- that a steady stream of young scientists are educated and trained in STEM disciplines.  The PI has in the past always strived to educate and widely disseminate the scientific knowledge acquired during his career to younger generation of scientists both from the U.S. and worldwide.  The present proposal will thus have a broader impact on the education and training of a young scientist.

This 3-year SHINE project is aimed at studying SEP events associated with filament eruptions on the Sun.  The goal is to isolate and investigate SEPs accelerated at CME-driven shocks with minimal flare material contributions.  The work expands on other researchers' recent results by using more instruments to cover a broader energy range and extend the analysis.  The methodology involves spectral and elemental composition data analysis techniques that are well established.  The dissemination of the scientific results will be made broadly to the scientific and space weather prediction communities through published articles, scientific talks, and personal communications.  In addition, project results and relevant data sets will be made available via the public web pages of the ACE and STEREO Science Centers.  The three project teams have excellent track record of publications, participating (often in leadership roles) in various workshops (e.g., SHINE), and attending scientific conferences.  Both the team leader and a Co-PIs are under-represented minorities and funding is included for the involvement of an undergraduate student.  The project will promote strong international collaborations for the benefit of advancing space weather research both in the USA and worldwide.<br/>  <br/>The research plan of this 3-year SHINE project includes four main tasks.  The first task is to examine the characteristics of heavy ions for previously identified events.  The spectral shape variation as a function of particle species reveals characteristics of the accelerating shock, while the composition provides important clues regarding the SEP seed population.  The second task is to study smaller SEP events associated with filament eruptions by using the more sensitive SEP sensors onboard ACE and STEREO.  The inclusion of STEREO data alone has the potential to increase the number of events suitable for study and, in combination with near-Earth spacecraft, allows the examination of SEP characteristics as a function of longitude.  The third task is to define stronger constrains on the primary acceleration region by combining calculations of the particle-release times, for both for single-and multiple-spacecraft events, with timing of the corresponding solar signatures.  The fourth task is to study in detail similar filament eruption events without associated SEP events in order to identify specific features that are key to SEP generation.  The project is directly relevant to the NSF's SHINE program, because it will provide important knowledge about the acceleration and transport of SEPs during solar eruptive events.  Such knowledge is critical for accurate modeling and prediction of space weather conditions from the solar surface to the Earth and beyond.

Studies using these tracers have seen a wide array of applications develop with many that bridge Earth science with disciplines such as chemistry, biology, and physics as well as applied science in industry and medicine. The applications have followed questions raised by stable isotope researchers as new ideas and technology have been developed where more precise and more finely focused measurements open up new types of studies, sometimes new fields. A recent example of such a development relates to the study isotopic of species with multiple substitutions of rare isotopes. These isotopic molecules or isotopologues can be used to interrogate questions well beyond those that can be studied with existing stable isotope techniques, and these new approaches promise to provide novel information relevant to study of geological, atmospheric, and biologic processes, and as in the past, to have implications within as well as beyond the traditional limits of Earth science.  <br/><br/>This grant supports acquisition of a recently developed state-of-the-art High Mass Resolution/High Sensitivity Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (HR/HS-IRMS) designed for measurements of isotopologues by a cross disciplinary team of University of Maryland scientists. The requested instrument will  support three, first-order scientific objectives: (1) identification of the sources, fluxes, and composition of mid-Atlantic States methane for implementing local controls and improved definition of the global budget and increasing atmospheric burden; (2) use of the doubly substituted isotopologues of molecular oxygen in combination with more traditional isotopic and concentration data for constraint of photosynthetic production  and respiration consumption of oxygen at the time of ice breakup in the arctic oceans; and (3)  development of a new isotopic system for sulfur (36S) that will provide new ways to study the ecology of the S metabolisms and the role of reoxidative S-cycling, including its connections to the global oceanic cycles of carbon and oxygen. The first objective will provide key information needed to understand the biogenic vs. fossil sources of methane on a regional and global scale; the second objective will contribute to understanding of the response of seasonally ice free marine systems in the Arctic, and the third objective will contribute to understanding the processes of S-cycling and their linkages to other element cycles in modern and ancient systems. The instrumentation will be the first of its kind on the east coast of the United States, supporting new mid-Atlantic research that will provide policy relevant science for the Maryland Climate Change Plan and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI involves nine states), as well as wider implications for methane cycling on the global scale. The instrumentation will support a wide range of research activities across the university system with a long-term goal of 30% external Earth Science users who will draw on its capabilities to extend its scientific and societally-relevant work. The instrumentation will promote teaching and learning with a central role in laboratory research that include mentoring of students from local high schools, undergraduate students, and visitors from other institutions. At the University of Maryland in particular, these activities will broaden the participation of under-represented groups, (women, African American, Hispanic) in Earth Science research. From the standpoint of activities that engage the public, the instrumentation will be incorporated into existing programs, including the Smithsonian Institution National Air and Space Museum Youth Program, the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) Choice Program, the UMD Freshman Innovation and Research Experience (FIRE) Program, as well as the Maryland Day open house when ~75,000 visitors come to campus."

This project intends to maintain a network of buoys with a spacing of less than 250 km, or more than 200 buoys spread across the Arctic Ocean, and with deployment logistics that include: 1) aircraft landing on the sea ice in the spring; 2) icebreakers deploying buoys for the IABP as opportunities arise; and 3) aircraft dropping buoys onto the sea ice. These observations are assimilated into Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models that are used to forecast weather on synoptic time scales, and into the many long-term atmospheric reanalyses that are used for climate studies. Overall, the observations from the IABP are essential for: 1) monitoring Arctic and global climate change; 2) forcing, assimilation, and validation of global weather and climate models; and 3) validation of satellite derived estimates of sea ice motion, surface temperature, and sea ice thickness. Further, IABP Observations are shared through the IABP server, the World Meteorological Organization and Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (WMO/IOC) Global Telecommunications System (GTS), and stored in publicly accessible archives including the NSF Arctic Data Center. These observations provide the longest continuing record for the Arctic and have been one of the cornerstones of the Arctic Observing Network for environmental forecasting and studies of climate and climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, such buoys rely on solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries for the energy they need for instrument operation.  These researchers plan to conduct pilot tests to evaluate a new technique dependably to utilize ambient ocean waves to provide dramatically greater power amounts than existing sources.  Dependable availability of larger power amounts to operate high-power instruments for long periods should be of interest the Ocean Science and Engineering communities.  Additionally, the methods and data from this project are also expected to be transferable to small platforms designed for mid-ocean recharging of autonomous vehicles.  <br/><br/>This research plans to test a new technique to control the wave energy conversion process such that the maximum practical power amounts can be converted in changing, irregular wave conditions. The team has learned through detailed hydrodynamic simulations and wave-tank testing that force and motion-constrained impedance matching control in realistic sea states can enable a 4-5 fold increase in the time-averaged power amounts that small oceanographic buoys might otherwise convert.  With modest hardware additions, this improvement could allow standard oceanographic buoys to use wave energy as a power source. However, the proposed control requires real-time up-wave surface elevation measurements for deterministic wave-profile prediction 20-30 seconds into the future, and a bi-directional power take-off capable of providing large forces. To that end, the pilot study will use a fully-instrumented, currently operational wave-energy converter buoy with a bi-directional electro-hydraulic power take-off, to quantify the performance improvements possible (over baseline resistive control) with constrained optimal acausal real-time wave-by-wave control of the buoy oscillations.  The team will use a high-resolution, short-range radar on-board the device to infer (up-wave) incoming wave fields for deterministic wave-profile prediction at the device.   Results will enable an evaluation of the immediate merit of wave energy relative to other power sources available for ocean sensing buoys, such as solar, wind, fuel cells, batteries, and diesel generators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet long-standing questions remain regarding how networks of microorganisms work together to accomplish the complete breakdown of organic carbon in marine sediments. Sediment microbes interact in a myriad of ways that couple their metabolism to the break down of organic carbon, including by sharing products of metabolism. Accumulating evidence further suggests that some microorganisms can interact by transferring electrons directly to other unrelated microorganisms. This ability occurs across diverse microorganisms and appears to be widespread in the biosphere, particularly in anaerobic environments such as marine sediments. This project addresses emerging questions about the identity and metabolic linkages between microorganisms that work together in natural anaerobic marine and estuarine sediments to break down organic carbon. The investigators approach these questions by focusing on the influence of a keystone bacterium on its surrounding microbial community. ""Cable bacteria"" are a recently discovered group of long filamentous bacteria that act as electrical conductors in aquatic sediments providing a conduit for electrons to commute from deeper sulfidic sediments up to the surface oxygen layer by the process of centimeter-scale electron transport. Since their discovery about 6 years ago, these bacteria have been observed in a wide range of depositional sedimentary environments, often at extremely high cell densities. Where these bacteria are abundant, such as in coastal marine muds, they drive intense localized changes in pH and strongly influence the mineral cycling. This research explorew the direct and indirect influence of cable bacteria on the metabolic activity of associated microorganisms. This project also advance the education and training of two early-career investigators, two PhD students, and undergraduate students. The skills and expertise gained from these PhD research projects will enable the students to be competitive in academic pursuits and in bioinformatics and technology applications relevant to private industry. The scientific discoveries emerging from this work is being incorporated into undergraduate and graduate level courses in marine microbial ecology. The research team will reach out to the broader community by hosting public lectures promoting a better understanding of environmental microbial ecology. <br/><br/>The proposed work is to investigate the role of cable bacteria in structuring sediment microbial communities. Due to their growth strategy and morphology, cable bacteria are particularly amenable to experimental manipulation, providing an outstanding opportunity to better understand community interactions among microorganisms in a natural and complex anaerobic environment. The investigators will explore the interactions and relationships between cable bacteria and their associated microbial community by manipulating the growth and activity of cable bacteria and quantifying the resultant microbial community response. Specifically, this project aims to (1) identify microorganisms whose growth is enhanced by cable bacteria, (2) identify metabolic processes linked with cable bacteria activity using metatranscriptomics, (3) test specific metabolic links between sediment microorganisms and cable bacteria activity using a DNA-stable isotope probing (SIP) approach, and (4) visually confirm the identity and quantify key microorganisms associated with cable bacteria using microscopy. As more is learned about the identity and the mechanisms by which microorganisms are metabolically linked in anoxic sediments, we will be better able to understand and make predictions about how microorganisms function in their environment and how they can be utilized in bioengineered systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. The Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, and integrates the co-production of knowledge. This award fulfills part of that aim.<br/><br/>The cold and dark wintertime conditions of the Arctic lead to frequent poor air quality episodes linked to local emissions along with temperature inversions that trap pollutants in the areas where people live. Infrastructure planning such as energy generation and industrial activities along with residential choices of heating fuels such as wood, fuel oil or others are critical aspects of this problem. Residents spend the majority of their time indoors during wintertime, so most exposure to pollutants occurs indoors. From this background, fundamental knowledge gaps were identified in: outdoor/indoor air transport, indoor pollution sources such as leaky heating appliances, and chemical transformation of pollutants under these Arctic conditions.  These gaps must be closed to understand the impacts of air pollution on Arctic communities and improve community health. Sustainably Navigating Arctic Pollution -- Through Engaging Communities (SNAP-TEC) focuses on improving understanding of wintertime Arctic outdoor and indoor air pollution. Discussions with community members will assist researchers in identifying local concerns regarding air quality and in designing appropriate sustainable development frameworks with the goal of improving air quality for Arctic peoples. <br/><br/>To investigate wintertime Arctic air pollution issues at the intersection of the natural and built environments and social systems, SNAP-TEC uses a convergence approach that starts with a community engagement process to build a research and co-generation of knowledge program that has direct impacts on the community. This project has grown out of organizing efforts under the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Project activity ""air Pollution in the Arctic: Climate, Environment and Societies"" (PACES) and the Alaskan Layered Pollution and Chemical Analysis (ALPACA) project, which have documented knowledge gaps in this area (see the ALPACA whitepaper, readily available online).  SNAP-TEC brings together a multi-disciplinary team to investigate this problem, with the center focus being a wintertime field campaign in Fairbanks, Alaska, where the scientific and social issues surrounding poor air quality can serve as a case study to inform practice and policy in similar cities and villages across the broader Arctic region. The resulting knowledge of pollution sources and chemistry, housing and pollution control technology, and social aspects can assist New Arctic communities to plan appropriate solutions that work for residents. Local and Indigenous peoples are most likely to be affected by Arctic development, so our community engagement process will include local Fairbanks residents and Alaska Native community members. The project measures indoor and outdoor air quality using state-of-the art instrumentation to advance fundamental understanding of air pollution sources and chemical processes under cold and dark conditions, indoor/outdoor air exchange and physicochemical changes to pollutants upon warming to indoor conditions, sulfur oxidation chemistry, and toxicity of air pollution. The field program is combined with community meetings, public participation in scientific data collection (a.k.a. citizen science, using inexpensive air-quality sensor monitoring) and a survey to assess public understanding of air quality, trust in science, perceived risk and uncertainty, and support for air quality policies. The SNAP-TEC research team involves a diverse group of natural and social scientists and engineers with extensive student involvement to address the problem. Through the international PACES organization, lessons learned from this investigation will be extended to an international pan-Arctic context through identification of fundamental processes and best practices, informing Arctic development and future studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This air-sea boundary layer in the rain field includes secondary droplets, stalks, crowns and surface waves that are generated by the impacts of rain drops. Experiments with various rain rates, rain drop diameters and spatial distributions of rain on the water surface will be carried out in two different facilities (rain tower and wind-wave tank) in a laboratory under various conditions of wind and waves. Since rainfall over the ocean makes an important contribution to air-sea transfer processes that affect weather and climate, the research will have a broad impact.  The project will contribute to the education of students in the sciences by supporting one graduate student and two undergraduate students. The PIs will also introduce the research to undergraduate classes and give approximately one talk or host one field visit to their research laboratory for local area high school students each semester in order to introduce them to the subject area of this research. It is hoped that this may foster interest in pursuing oceanography in their university studies. Also, results from this research will be posted on the web and photographs and videos and will be submitted to the Gallery of Fluid Motion of the American Physical Society (APS). Winners of this Gallery are published and posted on the web of the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics.<br/><br/><br/>Measurements will include the profile histories of stalks, crowns and surface waves at the center plane of the rain field using a cinematic laser induced fluorescence technique, the sizes and trajectories of both rain drops and secondary droplets using a holographic technique, and radar backscattering from the water surface in the rain zones using a pulsed ultra-wide band radar system. The goal of the laboratory experiments is to investigate the effects of wind and waves on the flow properties and mixing characteristics of the air- sea boundary layer in a rain field. The radar backscattering signatures in response to the changes of the air-sea boundary layer in the rain field will be investigated as well. Efforts to model air-sea transfer process are critically dependent on humidity and evaporation which are in turn greatly enhanced by rainfall. By using the physics learned from the proposed experiments, this study aims to produce important advancement in knowledge and understanding of how wind and waves affect the marine-atmospheric boundary layer in a rain field and make an important contribution that numerical modelers will find useful. Finally, advances in techniques for the measurement of rain impact on the water surface will result from the proposed work and will be applicable to similar measurements in other fields related to fluid mechanics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The idea that the ocean can sequester excess heat and thus disrupt continental warming trends or shift rainfall patterns is the subject of a rapidly growing research literature. Much of the observational basis for many studies of the hiatus is limited to the years since 2001 when the instrumental coverage of the oceans expanded due to Argo. An effort by meteorologists is refining and extending the surface meteorological record back to the nineteenth century. This proposal is a complementary effort to explore the limits of using data assimilation to combine historical observations, surface meteorology, and ocean dynamics to reconstruct the corresponding record of ocean heat and water storage. By elucidating the historical ocean climate record and the limits to what we can learn about past variability due to the historical data sampling this research provides a key piece of information for efforts to anticipate and predict future climate variability and change. The ocean reanalysis data sets produced will be made freely available to other researchers and the general community, which will foster further research benefits. This work will also form the basis of a dissertation for a University of Maryland graduate student.<br/><br/><br/>The ocean and sea ice systems are increasingly being recognized as playing a key role in climate variability and change and so making best use of the limited historical record must be a high priority. The recent hiatus in ocean warming seems to have been confined only to the past decade, but the oceans experienced a much more extended two decade hiatus beginning in 1970 and likely another in the 1940s and 1950s. It has been suggested that the reduced heating in the 1970s was the result of the effects of increasing aerosol loading on net surface heating. If so that should lead to significant differences in heat distribution from the recent hiatus (for which Pacific climate variability is likely important). The relatively cool North Atlantic of the 1940s ended a period of unprecedented warming of the Arctic. Is there evidence to suggest corresponding reductions of northward heat transport into the Arctic? Our understanding of the historical record of salinity is even less certain than temperature, but can the documented trends in upper ocean salinity be shown to alter the ventilation of water masses? The proposal will build on the PI's long term development of the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) reanalysis as a tool to explore the ocean's role in climate variability. A key emphasis will be on using observing system simulation experiments and data withholding experiments to explore the accuracy of those reconstructions to better understand the limits of application of such a reconstruction. With the combined use of hydrographic and tide gauge sea level data together in a hybrid ensemble data assimilation system, this proposal is to reanalyze ocean and sea ice variability (including sea level) from 1900 through 2015, and to use observing system experiments to quantify uncertainties. Justification for the work lies in the need to address the US CLIVAR (Climate Variability and Predictability) program's objectives of ""describing and understanding the ocean's role in climate variability on seasonal, interannual, and decadal timescales"" and the recommendations of the U.S. Global Change Research Plan 2012-2021."

Environmental policies often create controversy and can be difficult to enforce, particularly when people do not understand the reason for the rules or do not consider the rules to be fair. Natural resources can be better sustained by policies developed cooperatively among all affected stakeholders, scientists, and government representatives. In a systematic approach, the project team will hold a series of workshops in which a full set of stakeholders will work with scientists to guide development of a model, select policy objectives, and apply the model to make policy recommendations. A collaborative modeling approach will ensure that stakeholders have an opportunity to incorporate their values, objectives, and knowledge into the model of the estuarine ecosystem which will include many benefits from the natural system such as commercial and recreational fishing, safe swimmable water, and other ecosystem services.  Researchers will study the sociology and economics that influence stakeholder involvement and policy formation in order to better understand the human dimensions, improve the process, and enhance the implementation success of recommended policies. The lessons learned regarding the oyster ecosystem and fishery will advance the tools and practices of sustainable management of shellfisheries. The policy recommendations from the stakeholder workshops will be evaluated by state and federal agencies, and if implemented, would be an outcome that would directly enhance coastal sustainability. One Ph.D. student, two masters students, and one postdoctoral researcher will be trained in the science of coupled natural-human systems. This project is supported as part of the National Science Foundation's Coastal Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability program - Coastal SEES.<br/><br/>This research aims to improve the utility of predictive models for shaping natural resource policy and management.  The research team will build an innovative natural systems model that integrates three-dimensional hydrodynamic, water quality and larval transport models with oyster demographics, human uses, and economics at a scale that is applicable to restoration and management. The modeling system developed will substantially advance methods for investigating, and understanding, natural systems with complex feedbacks between physical conditions, vital rates of organisms, and humans. Researchers will include stakeholder values, objectives, and knowledge in the model design process. Through a series of workshops, stakeholders will select the policy objectives and the integrated model will project how well policies are expected to meet these objectives. This iterative process will ensure that the natural system model will incorporate the complex human uses of the ecosystem. A targeted effort will be made to study the socioeconomic drivers of stakeholder involvement, information flow, use and influence, and the policy formation in order to improve the process and enhance the implementation success of recommended policies. By doing so, this research will advance understanding of the human dimensions needed to create sustainable policy as well as provide important new strategies for integrating natural and social sciences, and scientists, in sustainable resource management. This generalizable research component provides an important complement to the research on oysters, both of which will advance the tools and practices of sustainable management of shellfisheries."

Homes, ecosystems, and millions of dollars of critical infrastructure are increasingly at risk of erosion,and various types of flooding. In order for CB communities to plan for the future, members must understand their local rates of sea level rise (RSLR) and the factors contributing to these local variations. A significant contributor to differences in RSLR is that land surrounding the CB is sinking (i.e. vertical<br/>land motion (VLM)) at different rates, but the causes behind these rates are not easily measured or widely understood. Scientists, town planners, and land managers must discuss the current science of VLM, how to monitor its rates across the CB, and possible mitigation strategies. Furthermore, scientists and a wide range of community stakeholders, including those in underrepresented rural areas, should understand how RSLR will have multiple impacts on residential communities, wetlands, and agriculture. They each have their own priorities that will influence what management options are most ecologically, socially, and economically desirable or feasible. Presenting the latest science on the causes of RSLR, anticipated land use changes, and the cost-effectiveness of different management options will empower the CB region and others facing similar threats from RSLR.<br/><br/>The team will convene two workshops: 1) Vertical Land Motion in the Chesapeake Bay, and 2) Evaluating Land Use Tradeoffs in the Chesapeake Bay. Workshop 1 will improve scientific understanding of the physical drivers of VLM rates in the CB and identify areas where understanding VLM rates may be most critical for land use planning. Workshop 2 will focus on how to effectively communicate VLM science and how rates of RSLR will cause land use changes and affect coastal communities. The goals of the workshops are to: 1) understand and disseminate the state of the science on VLM; 2) improve stakeholder understanding of accelerated RSLR; 3) learn how RSLR may change current land use practices, and 4)engage stakeholders throughout the workshop process. The workshop schedules involve: a) pre-workshop planning; b) holding workshop 1 c) workshop 1 synthesis and outcomes analysis; d) holding workshop 2; and e) a synthesis report and information distribution. Participants will include researchers, land conservationists, agricultural specialists, town planners, and community members, especially from underserved communities. At the end of these workshops there will be better information for use in community decision-making. Workshop organizers will assess how priorities differ among stakeholders and what factors most influence stakeholders' actions, which will guide selection of the research, tools, and outreach communities need to effectively plan for sea level rise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
