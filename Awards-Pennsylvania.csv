Machine learning, an important component of artificial intelligence, is revolutionizing much of what we do today. Deep learning is a relatively new subset of machine learning that has tremendous potential to improve our capabilities for industrial applications and scientific discovery. The use of artificial intelligence in hydrology, and deep learning in particular, can bring tremendous benefits to society. Hydrologic academics and professionals, however, have not historically taken advantage of artificial intelligence. While there have been some workshops and gathering opportunities for hydrologists interested in deep learning, there have been no dedicated workshops to build a community that can leverage common datasets, methods, and goals. A Machine Learning in Water Workshop (?Hydro-ML?) is proposed to demystify artificial intelligence for a wider audience in hydrology, build dedicated expertise and collaborative potential through training sessions and hackathons. Building a hydrological machine learning community will enable sharing of resources, organization of competitions stimulating an expansion of the field, and encourage collaboration among academics and professionals to solve large challenges. Special attention will be paid to participants' diversity both in terms of gender and race, which has previously been identified as an issue in artificial intelligence and hydrology. The topics covered by the symposium will be defined through solicitations to the community at large, with the intention of stimulating broader impacts in the hydrologic community. <br/><br/>The Hydro-ML symposium will build a collaborative community focusing on machine learning in hydrology. It will consist of four types of sessions: research presentations, breakout discussion forums, deep learning tutorials and hackathons, and community-building activities. Specific sessions will discuss forward-looking, overarching questions that will be solicited from the participants prior to the meeting.  These symposium activities will provide the foundation to build collective efforts in novel dataset identification, preparations for machine learning-in-hydrology competitions, and discussion of physically-informed machine learning. The symposium will be widely advertised through diverse channels, including hydrology newsletters and mailing lists, targeted communications to underrepresented, non-profit, and industry groups, and publications aimed at the general public. The organizing committee will encourage participation from diverse and underrepresented communities, and welcome those who are new to artificial intelligence. The outcomes from the symposium include collective publications serving as positional statements by the community (including journal papers and white papers), detailed plans for hydrologic machine learning competitions, and technical deep learning tutorials for audience with varied deep learning experience, ranging from newcomers to intermediate users. The symposium?s events will be aimed at building a diverse community that enables advancements in hydrology which will benefit society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nevertheless, leaf fossils alone currently provide limited information about the evolution of regional and global plant communities because individual leaf characteristics from a single plant species can vary widely, and detailed, time-consuming examination of each leaf fossil might still not connect it to its true biological family. This project addresses the problem in two ways. First will be the development of the Virtual Paleobotany Assistant (VPA), an artificial intelligence tool that will use machine learning techniques to rapidly analyze leaf characteristics to assign individual fossils to plant families and orders. The VPA, together with more traditional methods of paleobotany, will then be used to interpret the origins of the incredibly diverse tropical rain forests that now exist in Southeast Asia. These plant communities evolved during times of major continental movements and have connections to the former supercontinent of Gondwana, the Indian subcontinent, and Eurasia. Ascertaining the evolutionary and biogeographic pathways that led to the assembly of these tropical forests will help in preserving this important natural resource as the regional human population burgeons. The VPA will be made freely available on the internet and mobile platforms, enabling paleobotanists around the world to make discoveries far beyond this project. The unique collaboration between paleontologists and machine-learning experts will create extremely fertile ground for interdisciplinary advances, while catalyzing new international partnerships and student opportunities. <br/><br/>The project addresses two of the most difficult challenges in paleobotany, fossil leaf identification and the fossil history of Southeast Asian (Malesian) rainforests. Decoding the biological affinities of leaf fossils holds central significance for the improved knowledge of plant evolution, biogeography, and paleoclimate. This project will use deep learning on image databases of extant and fossil leaves to develop the first application (the Virtual Paleobotany Assistant, VPA) for computer-assisted identifications of leaf fossils to plant families and orders. The living floras of Southeast Asia are composed of a stunningly complex juxtaposition of plant lineages that diversified after arriving from disparate sources, including Gondwana (fossils to be studied in Patagonia and Australia), the Indian Plate (India and Pakistan), and Eurasia (South China, Indochina, Malay Archipelago). However, the diverse biogeographic components remain poorly understood due to limited paleobotanical data in many of the source areas. Many widely cited hypotheses are weakly corroborated from fossils; paleobotany and machine vision will coordinate to reveal the identities of fossil plants, correlate them to the geologic time scale, and re-interpret Malesia's floristic history. The influx of new paleobotanical data will test fundamental hypotheses about the relative contributions to Southeast Asian rainforest floras from different source areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Water cannot infiltrate into the ground when groundwater is close to the surface and is thus forced to quickly run off to rivers, creating higher flooding risks. However, the relationship between groundwater and floods has been found to be highly diverse and difficult to predict. Depending on terrain, groundwater depth, and many other factors, floods lead groundwater increase in some cases while groundwater can lead floods in others. Previous research from selected experimental watersheds have not resulted in a comprehensive and transferable understanding of the controlling processes. This project will take a big-data, machine learning approach to enhance our understanding of this relationship, allowing us to heuristically exploit previously under-utilized groundwater data for flood predictions and reducing damages. Using learning patterns from national-scale groundwater and streamflow data, the machine learning algorithms will create plausible groundwater-flood relationships. Taking advantage of the big hydrologic data from available satellite missions, this project will create shared undergraduate course modules to enhance student's ability to work with big data and increase their awareness of global water issues.<br/><br/>This research advances hydrologic science by answering the following overarching question: at catchment scales, do groundwater levels in the catchment provide predictive power for flood threshold functions and baseflow? We will address this question in multiple small steps. We will identify the kinds of groundwater-rainfall-runoff (GW-P-Q) relations that can be found over the Continental United States. These relations are quantified by the correlations between water table depths and flood thresholds (and baseflow) at different lags and time scales. We will seek the factors dictate the type of GW-P-Q relations and whether these relations are stable across seasons and years. We will employ two approaches: a human-directed classification analysis, and a knowledge distillation scheme based on deep learning (DL), a rapidly advancing group of techniques supporting the recent surge in artificial intelligence. In the first approach, we will use classification and regression tree to identify factors that could explain the GW-P-Q relations. In the DL-based approach, we will train continental-scale time series DL models using all available data to forecast discharge. This approach addresses the issue with classification trees in which not enough data are available for branch nodes. Through a novel knowledge distillation procedure, we transfer the knowledge gained in the deep network to more interpretable formats, including explicit mathematical formula. Results from the study will provide a comprehensive understanding of GW-P-Q relations where regional patterns and physical controls emerge. Besides gaining new knowledge, a significant by-product is the trained DL models. They can be used as a flood forecasting tool to integrate recent soil moisture and groundwater observations, which have not been exploited until now. The educational activity will mesh with the research activity by engaging undergraduate students in handling, visualizing and interpreting big hydrologic data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These microstructures help to explain phenomena that occur at the scale of mountains and tectonic plates.  Interpretation of microstructures formed in nature during deformation is aided by comparison with those formed during experiments, under known conditions of pressure, temperature, stress, strain and strain rate, and experimental rock deformation benefits from the ground truth offered through comparison with rocks deformed in nature.  However, the ability to search for relevant naturally or experimentally deformed microstructures is hindered by the lack of any database that contains these data.  The researchers collaborating on this project will develop a single digital data system for rock microstructures to facilitate the critical interaction between and among the communities that study naturally and experimentally deformed rocks.  To aid in the comparison of microstructures formed in nature and experiment, we will link to commonly used analytical tools and develop a pilot project for automatic comparison of microstructures using machine learning.   <br/><br/>Rock microstructures relate processes at the microscopic scale to phenomena at the outcrop, orogen, and plate scales and reveal the relationships among stress, strain, and strain rate.  Quantitative rheological information is obtained through linked studies of naturally formed microstructures with those created during rock deformation experiments under known conditions.  The project will develop a single digital data system for both naturally and experimentally deformed rock microstructure data to facilitate comparison of microstructures from different environments.  A linked data system will facilitate interaction between practitioners of experimental deformation, those studying natural deformation and the cyberscience community.  The data system will leverage the StraboSpot data system currently under development in Structural Geology and Tectonics.  To develop this system requires: 1) Modification of the StraboSpot data system to accept microstructural data from both naturally and experimentally deformed rocks; and 2) Linking the microstructural data to its geologic context ? either in nature, or its experimental data/parameters.  The researchers will engage the rock deformation community with the goal of establishing data standards and protocols for data collection, and integrate our work with ongoing efforts to establish protocols and techniques for automated metadata collection and digital data storage.  To analyze the microstructures studied and/or generated by these communities, we will ensure StraboSpot data output is compatible with commonly used microstructural tools.  They will develop a pilot project for comparing and analyzing microstructures from different environments using machine-learning."

It also facilitates the prediction of where hydrocarbon, water, mineral, and geothermal resources are buried in sedimentary basins. This project aims to advance our understanding of how sediment is transferred through the beds, bars, and levees of rivers in order to help i) answer questions about river response to changes in tectonics, climate, and sea level, ii) understand controls on river movements on Earth and other planets, and iii) predict the best places for underground energy development, mineral exploration and aquifer management. This project is providing training opportunities for students from underrepresented groups, thereby helping to develop a diverse geoscience workforce. This research is also producing large datasets?made available via data repositories? of experimental bedform characteristics and scaled stratigraphic measurements that will be a valuable teaching resource, and useful for geologists, geomorphologists, and civil engineers alike. In addition, the researchers are developing mini-tutorials and virtual field trips that can be used as classroom exercises for students and outcrop-interpretation exercises for scientists, including those with limited access to field experiences. Images and image interpretations are being incorporated into the machine learning project to support the development of automated outcrop interpretation tools.<br/>   <br/>This project is leveraging advances in geomorphology and sedimentary geology to quantitatively connect the role of sediment supply in sediment-transport processes across multiple scales to stratigraphic products. A combination of physical experiments, modeling, and field observations is being used to refine physical constraints on sediment transport rates of bedforms, bars, and channels, and to quantify how the shape and preservation of these features in the stratigraphic record relate to sediment-flux conditions at different scales. This insight is being applied to deposits of the Spanish Pyrenees ? a system with robust basin-scale sediment-flux constraints ? as a field calibration exercise. Subsequently, the developed approaches can help quantitatively test hypotheses about sediment-supply changes that occurred in response to the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum climate-change event. These efforts are yielding new insight into how sediment is partitioned between distinct but interrelated morphodynamic processes in fluvial landscapes, and providing a guide to how environmental and land-use change can affect river mobility on centennial to millennial timescales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop tools for automated interpretation of past environments from sedimentary outcrop data. Collaborative evaluation of outcrop datasets by geoscientists and computer scientists will yield new perspectives on how geological outcrop interpretation can be accomplished and provide a deeper understanding of the information required for automated interpretation of field data. Automating outcrop interpretation will broaden researchers? ability to rapidly mine existing and new digital datasets for information that will contribute new insights into the history of surface conditions on Earth and Mars. The tools developed as part of this project will be broadly disseminated and will integrate with existing digital platforms for field data. These tools will help facilitate collaborations among a broad range of geoscientists, including those who can?t easily conduct fieldwork in remote locations. This project will strengthen workforce development by cross-training sedimentary geologists with advanced computer science skills and will provide examples of practical applications of machine-learning approaches for computer science students.<br/><br/>To accomplish these goals, this project will leverage existing digital outcrop datasets and collect a new targeted dataset to explore automated approaches for extracting sedimentary features from outcrop image and surface-topography data. The project will focus on extracting sedimentary features that are critical for paleoenvironmental reconstruction, including types of cross bedding, and investigate how outcrop quality, scale, and orientation influence the recoverability of sedimentary features. Additionally, this project will explore the degree to which the three-dimensional orientation of sedimentary features can be extrapolated from automated outcrop observations. The tools developed in this project will be tested with structural geology and geomorphology outcrop datasets to evaluate how workflows developed as part of this work could aid a broader range of geoscience disciplines. Results will be packaged as an accessible online tool that can be used in combination with digital field data repositories.

These earthquakes occur on large faults that separate the descending oceanic plate from the overlying continental plate. Ground shaking from these earthquakes have significant human and economic impacts. Subduction zone earthquakes that rupture the seafloor can generate tsunamis that cause additional destruction. Regions of the world at risk from these earthquakes include the U.S. Pacific Northwest and Alaska, Central and South America, Japan, and Southeast Asia. Here, the researchers deploy a dense array of seismometers to image at high resolution a portion of the subduction zone that ruptured offshore northern Ecuador in a large earthquake in 2016. The project leverages data acquisition from an offshore and onshore deployment supported by European funding agencies. Analysis of the data provides an opportunity to link variations in structure and seismic properties along the subduction zone to the distribution of slip behaviors that culminates in large earthquakes. Results from this research improve seismic hazard assessment near subduction zones. The project also provides support for a graduate student in seismology and training of undergraduate students.<br/><br/>High resolution studies of subduction zones reveal their complexity and diversity of structure and physical properties. Heterogeneity downdip and along strike influences plate coupling and slip behavior on the plate interface, as well as in the downgoing plate and in the upper plate, which ultimately culminates in large magnitude earthquakes. The HIPER project (High Resolution Imaging of the Pedernales Earthquake Rupture Zone) is supported by French and German funding agencies. It acquires active and passive offshore-onshore seismic data along the northern Ecuador subduction zone in and adjacent to the 2016 Mw 7.8 Pedernales rupture. The HIPER project includes 60 ocean-bottom seismometers and 150 land stations that record active source shots from a 3D grid, followed by passive recording of earthquakes. Here, the U.S. team complete the project by deploying a dense array of 3-component short period nodes (~300) and 60 broadband sensors. The goal is to significantly densify the onshore portion of HIPER for active source recording.  It also widens the aperture of passive recording to improve lateral coverage and imaging at depth. The combined arrays present an exceptional opportunity for multiscale 3D imaging and examine the relationship between structure, fluids, and variations in slip behavior from seismic to aseismic. Ultimately, it allows to reconcile observations from geodesy and seismology with geology, structure, and seismicity. Data analysis employs machine learning generalized phase detection to significantly increase source detection.  It also involves a combination of traveltime and ambient noise tomography, and high frequency receiver functions as input to a multi-step series of inversions to constrain earthquake locations and seismic structure along and above the seismogenic zone.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, most magmas are transported in cracks between the deep crust and volcanoes, thus an understanding of the mechanics of these bodies is important for volcanic processes on the Earth and other planets. Hydraulic fracturing has revolutionized the fossil fuel industry and is another example of fluid-filled cracks under pressure. The mechanics of interacting cracks will be examined by applying a novel method that has been developed in biology: swarm theory. The principal investigator will use three methods to tackle the problem. First, mathematical models will be developed. Second, computational models will examine the parameters that lead to the development of crack swarms. Third, analogue experiments, which use artificial materials at room temperature and pressure, will be applied to simulate the processes in the earth and verify the analytical and computational models. The method has the potential to influence the design of new methods that will influence the conditions by which hydrocarbon and geothermal reservoirs are exploited.<br/><br/>A new modeling paradigm is proposed that is based on swarm theory in order to clarify the mechanisms that lead to self-organization of fluid-filled cracks. The proposed research aims to clarify the origin of the alignment, repulsion, and attraction forces within fluid-filled cracks and to demonstrate how the interplay of these forces leads to emergent length scales that provide a lasting and measureable imprint of the mechanical conditions governing emplacement. Analytical, numerical, and analogue models will be developed to test the hypothesis that the mechanical conditions governing emplacement will be systematically expressed in the emergent geometry of the swarm, applying the results in order to infer emplacement conditions using measurements of spacing, length, and width for naturally-occurring dyke swarms and industrial hydraulic fractures. Observations of natural and manmade systems reveal substantial differences: hundreds of igneous dikes grow together as swarms, but hydraulic fractures tend to localize to 1 or 2 dominant strands. This paradox presents a unique opportunity to understand the physical mechanisms that govern whether or not injection of fluid will result in a fluid-driven fracture swarm."

This heterogeneous character of natural faults is what makes earthquakes complex and difficult to predict. Some fault sections are mostly locked but recurrently host earthquakes. Other sections are creeping and generally stable. However, under poorly understood circumstances, earthquakes that nucleated in an unstable section can propagate far into stable fault sections and result in particularly large and destructive events. This project investigates the causes that lead to activation of the creeping fault sections by combining large-scale laboratory earthquake experiments with physics-based numerical simulations. The modeled fault consists of stable and unstable parts which realistically reproduce the mechanics of earthquakes at heterogeneous faults. A better understanding of the interaction between stable and unstable fault sections will help us evaluate the potential for extremely large earthquakes that will likely enhance existing seismic hazard assessment tools. This project is a benefit to society because it will help us to better understand earthquakes and develop tools to assess these hazards, and it will add to STEM education of students while supporting new researchers in earthquake studies.<br/><br/>This research is a collaborative effort to investigate the mechanics of earthquake rupture arrest with focus on heterogeneous fault properties. It combines multiscale laboratory experiments and numerical modeling. The experiments provide physical constraints for the numerical models, while the modeling improves understanding, generalizing, and scaling up the experimental results. Large-scale laboratory earthquake experiments are conducted on a biaxial machine that generates repeatable sequences of dynamic rupture events contained within a 3-m long granite sample. The fault surfaces are coated with gouge to generate patches of velocity-weakening and velocity-strengthening materials. To explore scaling effects, additional experiments are conducted on a 0.76 m tabletop biaxial machine using plastic samples as forcing blocks. Smaller-scale double-direct shear experiments will benchmark the frictional constitutive parameters of the gouge materials, an essential step for the interpretation of the larger-scale laboratory earthquake observations and the development of realistic, high-resolution numerical models of dynamic rupture and arrest. The simulations include sequences of slip events that quantitatively reproduce the relevant scales of the experiments including the actual size of the apparatus and the rupture process zone.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Given the steady U.S. population migration to urban centers, recruits will increasingly need to come from students who were raised in cities. The issues involved with recruiting urban geoscientists closely parallel those for recruiting from underrepresented groups. Many students and their families are unaware of the growing opportunities in the geosciences for careers that use advanced technology to solve some of the most challenging problems facing society. Urban geoscientists work on a wide range of local problems including waste management, flood control, beach nourishment, transportation infrastructure, land subsidence, and the environmental impact of ""fracking.""  To increase the size and diversity of the geoscience workforce and keep pace with demand in the 21st century, this project is testing new strategies, assessing what works, and sharing the model of an urban geoscience learning community with other universities.  New strategies include: developing materials highlighting career opportunities in urban geoscience, peer coaching in mathematics to assist students transitioning into science from other disciplines, and student apprenticeships to boost employment opportunities.  <br/><br/>The Career Paths for Urban Geoscientists initiative includes three main components. First, student recruitment is focused on developing career information for students and their parents to overcome misconceptions about opportunities. This information is being provided to prospective students during visits to the university, in general education and introductory-level courses in the department, and to the Alliance for Minority Participation on campus.  In addition to career information, service learning modules are being included in general education classes to inform students about applications for their new geology skills. Second, the Urban Geoscientists initiative is focusing on retention of new majors through a math-mentoring program. Math requirements are often a serious obstacle for students switching from non-science majors, and a reason many drop out of the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) majors.  The Math Partners program is pairing junior and senior geology and environmental science majors who have completed at least one semester of calculus as mentors for newly recruited majors. New students are benefiting from one-on-one coaching by majors who have experienced their struggles and who can help them grasp the increasingly important connections between quantitative skills and careers in the geosciences. The mentors reinforce their own understanding of mathematics through teaching.  Working together also promotes camaraderie within the major. The third component of the project is focused on enhancing Career Paths for Urban Geoscientists through apprenticeship that prepare them for the workforce. This includes a new certificate program that teaches job skills, internship opportunities with local companies, and undergraduate research experiences working with graduate students and faculty. The creation of learning communities of urban geoscientists involving alumni, faculty, undergraduate students, and graduate students in both science and education strengthens the initiative and is an explicit goal of this project. Assessment tools are being employed to determine the efficacy and timing of intervention. Outcomes such as an increase in majors, fewer repeated math courses, and retention in STEM are being assessed by demographic groupings. Using Temple University as a model of urban geosciences, the findings of this project are expected to be important for nation-wide recruiting through application at other universities striving to recruit and retain students from diverse backgrounds and prepare them for successful geoscience careers."

This particularly applies to students from rural areas who are the first in their family to attend college. These students are often academically gifted, but feel that they have to enter the workforce directly upon graduating with a BS degree, often due to financial hardship. This short-circuits these students' ability to participate in more intellectually demanding, rewarding, and lucrative geoscience careers, and limits the potential for universities to meet the projected future demands for the nation's geoscience workforce. To address this issue, the RiGs (Road maps into the Geosciences) summer program will form a multi-institutional alliance among the Missouri University of Science and Technology (S&T), Southern Utah University, Kutztown University (Pennsylvania), state/federal agencies in Missouri, and the private sector. The goal of RiGs is to (i) facilitate exposure of financially challenged STEM students from rural areas, at minimal to zero costs, to a wide array of geoscience career pathways, and (ii) to highlight the educational tracks and professional skills necessary to pursue those tracks. The RiGs program will provide an academic and professional development opportunity for financially challenged undergraduate students that these students would normally forego, thus serving as a pilot for increasing the economic competitiveness of the U.S. through rural workforce development.<br/> <br/>RiGs (Road maps into the Geosciences) will establish a recurring two-month summer program on the Missouri S&T campus that will help undergraduate students to successfully transition into the post-baccalaureate geoscience workforce. The focus is to immerse the students into an active research and/or private sector work environment that will allow them to develop academic and professional skills typically not taught in the classroom. Students will learn these skills through an Introduction to Geoscience Research Methodologies class, a mentored research project or job shadowing at state/federal agencies in Missouri, and a series of extracurricular activities. The Introduction to Geoscience Research Methodologies class is designed to provide context for the active, hands-on learning of practical skills applicable to geoscience research. As part of individual research projects, the students will be paired with Missouri S&T graduate students to guarantee full immersion into an active graduate research environment (i.e., the ""Grad School Experience""). Job shadowing at the US Geological Survey, the US Forest Service, and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources will provide participating students with unique insight into the daily life of a professional geoscientist, which will be complemented by a career day at the Doe Run lead mining company in Missouri. Furthermore, extracurricular activities throughout the summer program (team building exercises, mock job interviews, oral presentation skill development) will help students acquire the necessary professional and social skills for a successful geoscience career.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While it has been established that interactions between these two domains are complex, the mechanisms that underpin these interactions remain largely unknown. There is increasing recognition, however, that dissolved chemical cues govern these microbial interactions. This project focuses on establishing a mechanistic framework for how bacterially derived signaling molecules influence interactions between phytoplankton and bacteria. The quorum-sensing (QS) molecule, 2-heptyl-4-quinolone (HHQ) will be used as a model compound for these investigations. Previously published work suggests that exposure to very low levels of HHQ results in phytoplankton mortality. Gaining a mechanistic understanding of these ecologically important interactions will help to inform mathematical models for the accurate prediction of the cycling of material through the marine microbial loop. This work initiates a new, hybrid workshop-internship undergraduate research program in chemical ecology, with a focus into bacteria-phytoplankton interactions. Undergraduate students participate in an intense summer learning experience where research and field-based exercises are supplemented with short-lecture based modules. Students return to their home institutions and work closely with the PIs to conduct interdisciplinary research relating to the aims and scope of the summer research. This research also provides training and career development to two graduate students and a postdoctoral scientist.<br/><br/>Interactions between phytoplankton and bacteria play a central role in mediating biogeochemical cycling and microbial trophic structure in the ocean. The intricate relationships between these two domains of life are mediated via excreted molecules that facilitate communication and determine competitive outcomes. Despite their predicted importance, identifying these released compounds has remained a challenge. The PIs recently identified a bacterial QS molecule, HHQ, produced by globally distributed marine gamma-proteobacteria, which induces phytoplankton mortality. The PIs therefore hypothesize that bacteria QS signals are critical drivers of phytoplankton population dynamics and, ultimately, biogeochemical fluxes. This project investigates the timing and magnitude of HHQ production, and the physiological and transcriptomic responses of susceptible phytoplankton species to HHQ exposure, and quantifies the influence of HHQ on natural algal and bacterial assemblages. The work connects laboratory and field-based experiments to understand the governance of chemical signaling on marine microbial interactions, and has the potential to yield broadly applicable insights into how microbial interactions influence biogeochemical fluxes in the marine environment."

They also are of critical economic importance because they serve as the primary reserves used to extract iron, and iron accounts for 90% of the world's metal consumption.  Moreover, they can control the ability of soils to remove contaminants from groundwater because they frequently form as coatings on other soil minerals, such as quartz and feldspar. Even as only a microscopic veneer, they can attract and remove toxic metals, which otherwise would not react with the quartz or feldspar hosts.  In spite of their economic and environmental significance, geologists continue to debate how they form and what mechanism determines which of either hematite or goethite is likely to crystallize. Understanding this formation process matters because some scientists have used hematite and goethite ratios to infer the climatic conditions that generated ancient soils.  This project strives to determine the chemical conditions that dictate whether hematite or goethite will form in natural environments by using an innovative X-ray scattering technique that allows researchers to monitor iron oxide minerals at the atomic scale as they crystallize from fluids. In addition to this research helping scientists design more accurate historical (and predictive) climate models, the Investigators will also develop an interactive program that focuses on the geological and technological significance of iron oxides. These exercises will take advantage of a Smithsonian Learning Center called Q?rius, which attracts approximately 100,000 school children each year, and the U.S. National Museum of Natural History's extensive collection of iron oxide specimens to explain the important role of these minerals for maintaining the nation's technological and economic welfare.<br/><br/>Over the past decade, several studies have argued that the ratio of hematite to goethite in soils can yield quantitative estimates of mean annual precipitation, raising the possibility that hematite/goethite ratios in paleosols may serve as proxies for ancient climate.  The application of hematite/goethite proxies to Ordovician paleosols has, however, conflicted with the results of well-established climatic indicators.  Recent research by the Principal Investigators has revealed that the crystallization of hematite relative to goethite is determined by a complex interplay of solution pH, temperature, and time.  The PIs hypothesize that the formation of goethite is outcompeted in certain conditions by the metastability of 'hydrohematite,' a mineral discovered 175 years ago and discredited in the 1920s.  Specifically, they suggest that the reaction of ferrihydrite to hydrohematite is favored in alkaline systems (pH ~8) at low to moderate temperatures (below 130oC).  The composition of hydrohematite falls halfway between those of the goethite and hematite endmembers, and the transition from hydrohematite to stoichiometric hematite involves structural discontinuities suggestive of the onset of magnetic coupling between neighboring iron atoms.  The PIs will combine state-of-the-art, synchrotron X-ray diffraction techniques with computational methods to understand the factors that control the relative thermodynamic stabilities in this system of iron (hydr)oxide nanophases.  Accurate applications of hematite/goethite proxies for paleoclimate reconstruction require a rigorous understanding of the rates at which ferrihydrite alters to goethite and hematite and on the variables that influence which reaction products form.  The series of research thrusts outlined in this proposal will provide important constraints on the character and the rates by which iron (hydr)oxides evolve in maturing soils.  The results thus will improve the utility of hematite and goethite as a climate indicator, and they will reveal the relationship between the defect states and the physical properties and behaviors of iron oxides.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This volcanic ash (also called tephra) is deposited on land or in water bodies, and may become preserved in the geological record. Studies of tephra are important for a wide range of purposes including learning about the eruptive history of a volcano to anticipate potential future behavior, and correlating and dating rock layers for paleoanthropology and paleoclimatology studies. Traditionally, much of this work has been carried out by separate groups of researchers from these various disciplines, and a significant amount of data is then published in specialized literature, and hard to discover. A centralized database of tephra occurrence in East Africa would help overcome this barrier and encourage the use of existing valuable datasets, but also answer fundamental questions about the evolution of volcanism in East Africa through time. This project will address this need by building the East African Rift Tephra Database (EARThD), a comprehensive database that will integrate, standardize, and investigate geochemical and age tephra datasets from the East African Rift focusing on the record from the past 5 million years. <br/><br/>The EARThD project will utilize the existing NSF-supported community-based data facility, Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance (IEDA), to store, curate, and provide access to geochemical data and metadata through IEDA's EarthChem library. Tephra samples from published articles will be assigned an International Sample Geo Number (IGSN) and associated datasets and metadata will be entered and formatted using standardized IEDA templates. The development of EARThD will fulfill the currently non-existent but crucial data integration and standardization effort needed to support the growing East African Rift tephra record and the increasingly complex and interdisciplinary research questions being studied. It will benefit a broad scientific community by encouraging and facilitating the cross-disciplinary use of tephra geochemical data and involve undergraduate student researchers. Results of this project will provide a clearer understanding of the temporal variations of explosive volcanism along the East African Rift, including the frequency and magnitude of past eruptions and long-term geochemical variations in response to continental rifting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Interactions between microbial life, humans, and our environment influence essentially every aspect of daily modern life, from the treatment of medical conditions to agricultural innovations.  These interactions show how successful microbial life can be under a wide variety of conditions, on short time scales, and at the Earth's surface.  However, scientists also have evidence that microbial life is important over long time scales and deep underground.  In this project we will investigate the strategies that microbial life uses to survive under difficult circumstances while living deep underground.  In particular, we are interested in understanding whether microbial waste products can create new space for growth, new neighborhoods for microbial life, or condemn them to inevitable death.  From our scientific observations, we will create models that will help us understand how microbial life works underground.  Our results could be useful in understanding how microbial life will affect energy extraction processes, such as hydrologic fracturing ('fracking'), and underground waste disposal for some of our worst waste streams, such as nuclear materials. As part of our project, we will form a partnership with Community and Tribal Colleges of the Great Lakes Region. This partnership will focus on engaging underrepresented groups in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Rural Community and Tribal Colleges are primary conduits for post-secondary training and often serve as stepping stones to higher education in Native American communities of the region. We will develop and implement a hands-on summer workshop, 'The Life-Earth Connection', to be offered by our team during two consecutive summers at our field site. The workshops will provide an experiential learning opportunity that highlights the interactions of life, earth, and water through field and laboratory activities.

Our project leverages the experience of a collaborative scientific team that draws broadly on Earth Science disciplines: specifically, geology, hydrogeology, geochemistry, and microbiology. With a field study centered on legacy boreholes and archived cores, we will investigate Neoarchean fractured-rock aquifers of the Canadian Shield. Through this work, we will define: (1) subsurface hydrogeological and geochemical factors that support or inhibit microbial growth; (2) microbial adaptation to limiting factors through community interactions and metabolic innovation; and (3) the positive or negative feedbacks of microbial activity on the geogenic milieu and habitability.

Carbon is an important constituent in the aquatic food web and plays an important role in water quality. This research is novel because, instead of beginning with locally-observed phenomena and build process-based models that scale those mechanisms up to a larger scale, the investigator team will mine large observatory datasets for more global patterns followed by the investigation of smaller scale processes. The project provides interdisciplinary training in modeling, lab and field approaches for multiple graduate and undergraduate students. Furthermore, the team will collaborate with a minority-serving, K-5 elementary school to develop and administer a professional development workshop for Vermont's K-5 teachers.<br/><br/>Because forested headwater catchments cover large geographical areas, they have disproportionate effects on the dissolved fraction of organic carbon (DOC) and are closely monitored across the globe. Significant increases in DOC fluxes from forested streams across the northern hemisphere have been documented by numerous studies and potential causes such as changes in climate, land use or precipitation composition (i.e. recovery from acidification) are debated. The lack of focus on the specific mechanisms potentially driving the DOC release makes the prediction of future DOC fluxes nearly impossible. The investigators propose to address this gap with a combination of modelling and experiments to test the hypotheses that 1) an increase in stream water DOC flux is driven by the regionally observed recovery from acidification (i.e. the increase in pH and decrease in ionic strength of wet and dry deposition), 2) DOC is released from soil aggregates that become unstable under these changing conditions, and 3) aggregate stability and DOC release is a function of soil composition and mineralogy, leading to the varied responses (presence or absence of DOC increase) despite potentially similar regional forcings. Big Data analysis using novel data-driven modelling techniques will use USGS and Critical Zone Observatory datasets to probe regional-scale data (>100 km) and identify general patterns (test hypotheses 1). Results from this step will inform selection of sites for more detailed process-based investigation at the catchment (km) to soil aggregate scale (micrometer) using Reactive Transport Modelling and experiments (test hypotheses 2-3). This research addresses a highly debated topic in C dynamics (i.e. increase DOC fluxes) and furthermore works toward a framework for the integration of scales, disciplines and approaches in low temperature geochemistry. The combination of statistical and process-based modelling with experiments to bridge scales varying >10 orders of magnitude is novel and potentially transformative for the field of low temperature geochemistry. The impact of this research is broadened by the interdisciplinary training provided for three graduate students and multiple undergraduate students. Furthermore, the investigators will collaborate with the College of Education and a minority-serving, K-5 school to develop and administer a professional development workshop for Vermont's K-5 teachers. Goals for this workshop are to i) provide professional development for K-5 educators on the Critical Zone as a framework for sustainability learning and ii) to begin to develop teaching modules with participating educators for the appropriate K-5 level."

The CZ is Earth's surface layer between the top of the vegetation canopy and the base of groundwater.  Such understanding will help society to better adapt to and manage the effects associated with ongoing land-use and climate change. This proposal proposes to create an international Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) SAVI as an integrating activity for Earth surface geosciences research worldwide.<br/><br/>The aim of this proposal is to address important and outstanding charges that challenge the U.S. CZO program: How can individual sites articulate and answer network-wide questions? How can the diverse CZOs make some measurements in a coordinated fashion at all CZOs? Proponents hypothesize that development of such measurements and questions requires focused leadership and a concerted effort that entails 5 years of workshops, graduate and postgraduate student mentoring, and targeted research projects that demand common measurements. They have proposed an approach to the development of international cross-CZO science, and to establish a new cadre of truly interdisciplinary and international scientists through graduate student and postdoctoral training. <br/><br/>This CZO SAVI will establish a framework to address major challenges that face humanity with respect to habitability of the CZ. This project will engage U.S. and international partners from diverse networks by: 1) learning to explore and measure the essential variables underpinning models of the CZ; and, 2) supporting a U.S. group of junior scientists to become the next-generation of international scholars of the CZ.

In turn, publicly accessible datasets are an imperative for a country to benefit from its science. In the past, scientists have relied mostly on printed data, often published in many journals from around the world. Today, data are increasingly available online. The increase in data availability allows scientists to use integrated datasets and to test models. In this period of increasingly 'big data,' scientists are working together with data specialists to learn to manage, share, and interrogate data. Some disciplines lag in the process of publishing data online for data sharing and public accessibility. One example is low-temperature geochemistry and geobiology (LTGG). LTGG includes data for water, soils, rocks, air, organic material, built materials, living organisms, and other materials. The sheer diversity of samples and diversity of types of analyses makes these datasets difficult to manage. Some datasets are very large (sensors, remote sensing) while others are relatively low in volume but high in descriptive complexity. These issues lead to questions about the best way to move forward with data management in LTGG, and the best way to strategize about data publication in this field. This proposed effort will fund a series of webinars, surveys of the community, a workshop, a post-workshop meeting, a white paper, and final publication that will address the question of what to do with data in the field of LTGG. With these publicly accessible outcomes, the work will position the LTGG for a future of data sharing that provides data to the public and promotes open science.  <br/><br/>A workshop is proposed to be held in 2020 to develop a proposed roadmap for geochemical data for the Low-Temperature Geochemistry and Geobiology program at NSF. This workshop will bring together leading scientists in the fields of geochemical science and data science. The workshop will be held in university or hotel facilities in a hub for major airlines to facilitate travel by participants. The final goal of this workshop will be to produce a written document that lays the groundwork for advances in management of low-temperature geochemical and geobiological data (with little to no emphasis on genomics data). The first product will be development of a white paper that will be placed online for public comment.  After receiving comments, the team will write a peer-reviewed publication with lessons learned and the roadmap. In the workshop, small- and large-group discussions will be fostered so that workshop participants can identify needs within geochemistry and data science that could be addressed. Participants will also develop a list of targeted priorities for the roadmap. All participants will listen to webinars and write text before the workshop: this will ensure that a white paper and final publication will be completed. All facilities and materials will be accessible to anyone who needs accommodations (hearing-, sight-impaired or the physically disabled).

Global costs of rapid sea-level rise to infrastructure (e.g., houses, roads, farms, ports) are likely to be large.  A possible source of water for sea-level rise is the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and Thwaites Glacier in particular.  Ice sheets and glaciers contain vast quantities of water (in the form of ice) that is continually shed to the ocean, and continually replenished by snowfall (from water that evaporates from the oceans).  If the amount of ice that Thwaites Glacier loses to the ocean over the next decades is much greater than the amount it receives as snowfall, then sea level in all the world's oceans would rise, possibly as much as a meter (approximately 3 feet).  In order to estimate how likely such a catastrophic scenario would be, we need to better understand the surface over which Thwaites Glacier slides.  If we can better characterize that layer (""is to smooth? Is it rough? Is it soft? Is it hard?""), then computer models of Thwaites would be much improved and we can make better projections of the amount of ice that Thwaites Glacier would shed to the ocean.<br/><br/>The objectives of the project are to learn whether basal conditions allow for rapid retreat of the Thwaites Glacier grounding line or whether retreat may re-stabilize near its current grounding line. These objectives will be achieved by using dedicated ice-flow modeling to guide targeted field surveys and experiments over two seasons, and to measure the most important unknown quantities and incorporate them into the models. Numerical models will be used to generate hypotheses for basal conditions that are testable through geophysical surveys and to project future behavior of Thwaites Glacier after assimilating the resulting data. The geophysical methods include seismic, radar, gravity, and electrical surveys that together will allow for a fuller characterization of the bed.  We will conduct field surveys in areas representative of different parts of the glacier, including across the margins, near the grounding line, and along the central axis of the glacier into its catchment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dr. Nell Hoagland has been awarded a postdoctoral fellowship to work at the Colorado School of Mines to determine the conditions driving the sequestration or release of arsenic (As) from the hyporheic zone in rivers impacted by acid mine drainage. Using a combination of microbial and hydrological methods, the researcher will investigate the spatial and temporal scaling of the hyporheic zone, where groundwater-surface water interactions modulate the timing, magnitude, and speciation of solutes. This work will build upon previous U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) investigations of the hyporheic zone in the Animas River of Colorado, where an accidental breach of mine pond wastewaters in August 2015 led to the release of 11 million liters of tailings directly into the river. By constraining the location and timing of total As and As(III) fluxes to the stream channel, this study will provide the geochemical and hydrological context needed to develop engineering solutions for river recovery in mine-impacted catchments. New insights related to the timing of As release to the Animas River will be shared in a publically accessible technical report with public health officials and municipal water authorities in the affected region. This project will engage undergraduate and graduate students at Colorado School of Mines and local community colleges by offering a summer short-course, where students will learn about the field of environmental hydrology and the impacts of acid mine drainage. <br/><br/>The biogeochemical processing of metalloids such as arsenic is unpredictable in redox transition zones. Redox conditions in the hyporheic zone will change on seasonal and storm-event scales, impacting net As release or storage. The working hypotheses for this study include: (a) the export of total As and the ratio of As(III)/As(V) from the hyporheic zone in an acid mine drainage stream increases over the course of a storm event in response to increasingly reduced sediment conditions, and (b) the hyporheic zone acts as a source of As to the stream channel during the summer (e.g. wet, high discharge) and a sink of As in the winter. The proposed work will evaluate the hyporheic zone at high temporal and spatial resolution in order to provide new information on microbial and mineralogical mechanisms controlling As speciation across redox gradients. Deliverables will include a conceptual model that relates climatic controls on hyporheic zone area and exchange rates to the mobilization of contaminants from hyporheic sediments at the reach-scale. The conceptual framework in combination with reactive-transport modeling will guide interpretations of contaminant transport at the watershed-scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ability of coral reefs to continue providing these services to society is currently threatened by climate change, which has led to increasing ocean temperatures and acidity that can lead to the death of corals, the animals that build the reef framework upon which so many species depend. This project examines how temperature and acidification stress work together to influence the future health and survival of corals. The scientists are carrying out the project in Hawaii where they have found individual corals with different sensitivities to temperature stress that are living on reefs with different environmental pH conditions. This project improves understanding of how an individual coral?s history influences its response to multiple stressors and helps identify the conditions that are most likely to support resilient coral communities. The project will generate extensive biological and physicochemical data that will be made freely available. Furthermore, this project supports the education and training of undergraduate and high school students and one postdoctoral researcher in marine science and coral reef ecology. Hands-on activities for high school students are being developed into a free online educational resource. <br/><br/>This project compares coral responses to acidification stress in populations experiencing distinct pH dynamics (high diel variability vs. low diel variability) and with distinct thermal tolerances (historically bleaching sensitive vs. tolerant) to learn about how coral responses to these two factors differ between coral species and within populations. Experiments focus on the two dominant reef builders found at these stable and variable pH reefs: Montipora capitata and Porites compressa. Individuals of each species exhibiting different thermal sensitivities (i.e., bleached vs. pigmented) were tagged during the 2015 global coral bleaching event. This system tests the hypotheses that 1) corals living on reefs with larger diel pH fluctuations have greater resilience to acidification stress, 2) coral resilience to acidification is a plastic trait that can be promoted via acclimatization, and 3) thermally sensitive corals have reduced capacity to cope with pH stress, which is exacerbated at elevated temperatures. Coral cells isolated from colonies from each environmental and bleaching history are exposed to acute pH stress and examined for their ability to recover intracellular pH in vivo using confocal microscopy, and the expression level of proteins predicted to be involved in this recovery (e.g., proton transporters) is examined via Western blot and immunolocalization. Corals from each pH history are exposed to stable and variable seawater pH in a controlled aquarium setting to determine the level of plasticity of acidification resilience and to test for pH acclimatization in this system. Finally, corals with different levels of thermal sensitivity are exposed to thermal stress and recovery, and their ability to regulate pH is examined over time. The results of these experiments help identify reef conditions that promote coral resilience to ocean acidification against the background of increasingly common thermal stress events, while advancing mechanistic understanding of coral physiology and symbiosis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
