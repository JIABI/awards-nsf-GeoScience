Nevertheless, leaf fossils alone currently provide limited information about the evolution of regional and global plant communities because individual leaf characteristics from a single plant species can vary widely, and detailed, time-consuming examination of each leaf fossil might still not connect it to its true biological family. This project addresses the problem in two ways. First will be the development of the Virtual Paleobotany Assistant (VPA), an artificial intelligence tool that will use machine learning techniques to rapidly analyze leaf characteristics to assign individual fossils to plant families and orders. The VPA, together with more traditional methods of paleobotany, will then be used to interpret the origins of the incredibly diverse tropical rain forests that now exist in Southeast Asia. These plant communities evolved during times of major continental movements and have connections to the former supercontinent of Gondwana, the Indian subcontinent, and Eurasia. Ascertaining the evolutionary and biogeographic pathways that led to the assembly of these tropical forests will help in preserving this important natural resource as the regional human population burgeons. The VPA will be made freely available on the internet and mobile platforms, enabling paleobotanists around the world to make discoveries far beyond this project. The unique collaboration between paleontologists and machine-learning experts will create extremely fertile ground for interdisciplinary advances, while catalyzing new international partnerships and student opportunities. <br/><br/>The project addresses two of the most difficult challenges in paleobotany, fossil leaf identification and the fossil history of Southeast Asian (Malesian) rainforests. Decoding the biological affinities of leaf fossils holds central significance for the improved knowledge of plant evolution, biogeography, and paleoclimate. This project will use deep learning on image databases of extant and fossil leaves to develop the first application (the Virtual Paleobotany Assistant, VPA) for computer-assisted identifications of leaf fossils to plant families and orders. The living floras of Southeast Asia are composed of a stunningly complex juxtaposition of plant lineages that diversified after arriving from disparate sources, including Gondwana (fossils to be studied in Patagonia and Australia), the Indian Plate (India and Pakistan), and Eurasia (South China, Indochina, Malay Archipelago). However, the diverse biogeographic components remain poorly understood due to limited paleobotanical data in many of the source areas. Many widely cited hypotheses are weakly corroborated from fossils; paleobotany and machine vision will coordinate to reveal the identities of fossil plants, correlate them to the geologic time scale, and re-interpret Malesia's floristic history. The influx of new paleobotanical data will test fundamental hypotheses about the relative contributions to Southeast Asian rainforest floras from different source areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In order to grow, these phytoplankton require nutrients that are dissolved in seawater. One of the rarest and most important of these nutrients is iron. Even though it is a critical life-sustaining nutrient, oceanographers still do not know much about how iron gets into the ocean, or how it is removed from seawater. In the past few years, scientists have made many thousands of measurements of the amount of dissolved iron in seawater, in environments ranging from the deep sea, to the Arctic, to the tropical oceans. They found that the amount of iron in seawater varies dramatically from place to place. Can this data tell us about how iron gets into the ocean, and how it is ultimately removed? Yes. In this project, scientists working on making measurements of iron in seawater will come together with scientists who are working on computer models of iron inputs and removal in the ocean. The goal is to work together to create a program that allows our computer models to ""learn"" from the data, much like an Artificial Intelligence program. This program will develop a ""best estimate"" of where and how much iron is coming into the ocean, how long it stays in the ocean, and ultimately how it gets removed. This will lead to a better understanding of how climate change will impact the delivery of iron to the ocean, and how phytoplankton will respond to climate change. With better climate models, society can make more informed decisions about how to respond to climate change. The study will also benefit a future generation of scientists, by training graduate students in a unique collaboration between scientists making seawater measurements, and those using computer models to interpret those measurements. Finally, the project aims to increase the participation of minority and low-income students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) research, through targeted outreach programs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Iron (Fe) is an important micronutrient for marine phytoplankton that limits primary productivity over much of the ocean; however, the major fluxes in the marine Fe cycle remain poorly quantified. Ocean models that attempt to synthesize our understanding of Fe biogeochemistry predict widely different Fe inputs to the ocean, and are often unable to capture first-order features of the Fe distribution. The proposed work aims to resolve these problems using data assimilation (inverse) methods to ""teach"" the widely used Biogeochemical Elemental Cycling (BEC) model how to better represent Fe sources, sinks, and cycling processes. This will be achieved by implementing BEC in the efficient Ocean Circulation Inverse Model and expanding it to simulate the cycling of additional tracers that constrain unique aspects of the Fe cycle, including aluminum, thorium, helium and Fe isotopes. In this framework, the inverse model can rapidly explore alternative representations of Fe-cycling processes, guided by new high-quality observations made possible in large part by the GEOTRACES program. The work will be the most concerted effort to date to synthesize these rich datasets into a realistic and mechanistic model of the marine Fe cycle. In addition, it will lead to a stronger consensus on the magnitude of fluxes in the marine Fe budget, and their relative importance in controlling Fe limitation of marine ecosystems, which are areas of active debate. It will guide future observational efforts, by identifying factors that are still poorly constrained, or regions of the ocean where new data will dramatically reduce remaining uncertainties and allow new robust predictions of Fe cycling under future climate change scenarios to be made, ultimately improving climate change predictions. A broader impact of this work on the scientific community will be the development of a fast, portable, and flexible global model of trace element cycling, designed to allow non-modelers to test hypotheses and visualize the effects of different processes on trace metal distributions. The research will also support the training of graduate students, and outreach to low-income and minority students in local school districts."

These broad areas of weaker rainfall typically contain high, relatively flat clouds similar to the ""anvils"" seen above isolated thunderstorms.  The high stratiform clouds are a consequence of the convective cells, just as the anvil forms only after a thunderstorm is fully developed.  But the presence of a broad region of upper-level stratus can affect the subsequent development of convective clouds, or in other words it can promote large-scale convective aggregation and organization.  Upper-level clouds encourage new cloud formation by blocking outgoing infrared radiation, heating the column below and promoting rising motions.  The effect is thought to be important over tropical oceans where the frontal weather systems that organize convection in higher latitudes are largely absent.  But understanding of this infrared cloud-radiation feedback and its effects on tropical weather and climate is currently quite limited.<br/><br/>Work under this award addresses the role of cloud-radiation feedback in the development of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), in which a large region of convection organizes over the tropical Indian Ocean and propagates slowly eastward for a period of 30 to 60 days.  Cloud-radiation feedback has been invoked as a cause of convective organization in the MJO and as a key factor in determining its propagation speed.  A second issue addressed in the proposal is the possible role of convective organization in determining the Earth's climate sensitivity, meaning the amount of global warming or cooling that results from a given increase or decrease in greenhouse gas concentrations.<br/><br/>The research is conducted through a combination of observational analysis and numerical simulations.  The observational analysis uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) applied to satellite and weather balloon data to determine how stratus cloud development relates to ambient temperature, moisture, and stability in the cloud layer.  The relationships identified by the ANN are interpreted using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), a technique that identifies the inputs which matter the most for generating an ANN result.  The value of machine learning tools like ANN for basic science is often questioned because of their ""black box"" nature: while machine learning methods can have uncanny predictive power, their results do not come with any explanation for why a particular set of inputs produces a given result.  LRP is thus a means to open the black box and gain physical insight and understanding from the empirical relationships identified through the ANN machinery.<br/><br/>The work has societal relevance due to the worldwide effects of the MJO, which influences weather and climate phenomena including tropical cyclones (particularly in the Gulf of Mexico), the amount and timing of monsoon rainfall, and the onset of El Nino events.  MJO events are predictable in principle given their slow propagation, but prediction skill is limited in current weather and climate models. The possible influence of convective organization on climate sensitivity is also of societal interest given the rapid rise of greenhouse gas concentrations. The project also contributes to workforce development by providing support to an early-career scientist.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To overcome these challenges coupled natural-human systems approaches and analyses are needed. These provide improved scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of direct and indirect drivers such as land use, invasive species, overexploitation, biodiversity, environmental change, and pollution. The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. Employing this methodology, this research project, which is an international coalition between US scientists and five European nations, seeks to quantify the magnitude, spatial extent and timing of aerial migrations (birds and insects), and their functional relations to environmental and socio-economic variables. Migratory bird and insect populations involve thousands of tons of animal biomass that move through the air within and across continents at various times of the year. Migratory flying animals play significant roles in shaping ecosystems through a variety of transport and trophic effects that also represent services and disservices to human infrastructure, agriculture, and welfare. This project reveals the role these organisms have in shaping the diversity of ecological communities, as well as providing information to allow the better utilization of their related ecosystems services and reducing their negative impacts. This requires the tracking and quantification of these species and their movements across continents, i.e. over large spatial and temporal scales. This study investigates past changes in important drivers of change such as climate; the expansion of urban areas; deployment of energy infrastructure, like wind farms; and changes in land use/agriculture. Data and results will be modeled to develop projections for future changes under environmental and human-induces scenarios. Current and archived radar data of biomasses of aerial migrants will be used. Drivers resulting in changes in patterns of migrations and local ecosystem function will be used to develop behavior-based models for generating predictions under future changes. The broader impacts of this work include international collaboration with scientists from five other countries (UK, Belgium, The Netherlands, Finland, and Switzerland), the generation of data to improve policy and resource management decisions, and information to help reduce airplane damage from bird strikes. Other impacts include training a postdoctoral scholar in interdisciplinary, international, team-oriented, collaborative research and the creation of new software that allows others to process data on aerial migrations in terms of variables such as weather, climate, land use, wind, and light.<br/><br/>This award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility and fill gaps in knowledge. Using this methodology, this major international effort between the US and five European countries will addresses challenging and pressing biodiversity issues related to aerial migratory species (birds and insects) across scales from local to continental. For the project, each country will fund its own scientists and their part of the overall project. The interdisciplinary team consists of ecologists, meteorologists, and computer scientists who will use the existing infrastructure of continental weather (and other) radars to generate a standardized large-scale, long-term monitoring of migratory aerial biomass flows, as well as develop sustainable data and analytical infrastructure and workflows that that can be used by other present and future stakeholders. Motivation for this study comes from the fact that aerial migratory animals are an integral component of biodiversity and have been declining at an alarming rate. Identifying their response to climatic and land-use changes, light pollution and wind energy development is fundamental for efficient conservation and mitigation of human-wildlife conflicts. Thus, this research links various stakeholders from scientists to meteorologists to conservation practitioners and policy makers and to the wind energy sector and aviation safety. Goas are to develop (a) standard long-term and large-scale monitoring of aerial migrations; (b) information to feed policies associated with the proliferation of artificial light; (c) establish aerial migratory species death-mitigation procedures for wind energy installations and aircraft; and (d) policies for conservation of crucial (aerial) habitat, migratory locations, and major migration time-periods that are essential for sustaining migratory populations. Research will entail quantifying the magnitude, spatial extent, and timing of aerial migrations; understanding their (functional) relations with environmental and socio-economic variables; and projecting the consequences of future changes in these variables on migratory populations. This will be achieved by retrieving biological information from weather radar networks using methods that rely on machine learning and statistical analyses to quantify biomass flows of aerial migrants in Europe and North America. It will also estimate the role of migrants in ecosystem functioning and how aerial migratory biomass flows is impacted by external human induced variables.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the same time, the Arctic as a whole is experiencing unprecedented changes and setting new records, including the decline of Arctic sea ice cover, the decline and early snowmelt onset of Northern Hemisphere snow cover, and an overall warming at a rate more than double anywhere else on the planet.  Studying and understanding the mechanisms linking the different Arctic components (Greenland, snow cover, and sea ice in the case of this research) and how, in turn, their changes are related to and driven by the atmosphere is fundamental to capture the physical processes driving the changes. This is, indeed, one of the key aspects to considerably improve our skills in estimating the future evolution of the Arctic under different warming scenarios and in projecting future sea level rise.<br/><br/>This research is quantifying the relationships between sea ice, snow cover, atmospheric circulation changes and mass changes over the Greenland ice sheet through a combination of observational and modeling tools. These include in situ observations of sea ice cover and snow extent as well as remote sensing products and estimates of atmospheric circulation changes and outputs from climate models. We also use artificial intelligence (e.g., neural networks) to examine relationships between climate, atmospheric patterns and Greenland changes. Ultimately, this research is testing the hypothesis that atmospheric circulation changes associated with sea ice and snow cover extent variability control the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet by modulating snowfall and surface melting. This research is also providing new insights on the linkages between the Arctic and mid-latitudes and how sea ice and snow cover changes might affect weather patterns outside the Arctic, including the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Koopman operators were derived in the early 1930s and used to prove an important theorem on the behavior of idealized dynamical systems. But they remained largely unknown beyond dynamical systems theory until the early 2000s, when their usefulness for complicated, data intensive problems was recognized. Since then, the idea of Koopman operators in combination with machine learning algorithms has been applied to various problems in fluid dynamics, stability analysis of power networks, the development of financial trading algorithms, and brain activity research. Like these applications, climate research is often data-driven and involves analysis of a complex system, thus Koopman operators could be a valuable addition to the climate research toolkit. <br/><br/>The advances in pattern extraction and predictive capabilities for complex systems stemming from this project will have great impacts in the field of nonlinear dynamical systems and will be applicable to various disciplines that deal with time-evolving phenomena, from climate science, fluid dynamics, to neuroscience and economics. The project will contribute towards STEM workforce development through the training of a postdoc and new course development for on data-driven dynamical systems modeling at Principal Investigator's home institution.<br/><br/>This project will advance machine learning techniques and spectral Galerkin methods for identifying Koopman eigen-frequencies and eigenfunctions of complex dynamical systems that are subject to both stochastic forcing and external forcing (such as the Earth's climate system) from time series and spatiotemporal data without knowledge of the underlying governing equations and boundary conditions. The team will apply the data-driven methods to climate simulations of El Nino Southern Oscillation to study the interactions of natural variability and forced response of the climate system. This will demonstrate the ability of the methods to reveal and predict many aspects of the temporal evolutions of dominant modes in data, which cannot be achieved from conventional covariance-based methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. Employing this methodology, this research project, which is an international coalition between US scientists and those from Fennoscandinavian nations, seeks to use birds as bioindicators of environmental health on large scales such as changes to farming or forestry practices and on smaller scales such as environmental recovery from localized severe weather or pollution events. This choice of indicator is because birds are valuable indicators of environmental conditions because they are ubiquitous in most environments, with different species having different food and habitat requirements. Thus, birds, as a group, sample environments in different ways during the process of acquiring food which can range from small organisms, such as plankton, to animals larger than rabbits, depending on the species of bird and its evolved food requirements.  Additionally, when environmental conditions make food scarce, most species of birds simply fly away and seek more conducive environs. As a result, the response of birds to changing conditions can be far more rapid than the responses of less mobile organisms.  Birds are also typically visually and vocally obvious and there are bird-watching hobbyists (i.e. citizen scientists) across the globe who observe and record the birds they see throughout the year and what those birds are doing.  Thus, large amounts of data exist from which we can learn about the environmental conditions preferred by a large number of species of birds.  Project goals are to: (1) create methods for identifying a set of bird species that are good indicators of environmental conditions in habitats such as alpine/arctic tundra, highly managed and natural forests, and farmland and (2) use this information to anticipate changes in physical conditions (e.g., weather) and those caused by people (e.g., land use and farming practices).  Broader impacts of this research include international collaboration scientists in Norway, Sweden, and Finland and the use of citizen science and the collection of data by the birdwatching public. Impacts also include those that are societal and economic in terms of the relation of study results to achieving sustainable harvests and fisheries. Other impacts include development of a planning tool for minimizing losses of key ecosystem services from birds in forest regeneration, pest management, and sustainable harvests that can be used by resource managers. Results of the study will be valuable for the development of science-based policies where avian species play a role.<br/><br/>This award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"".

Project objectives are to improve methods for predicting the responses of birds to changes in their environments. Instead of merely looking at correlations between where species live and features of the environments they inhabit or travel though, this work examine the causal associations between birds and their environments by looking at functional traits (i.e., those that lead birds to respond to changes in their environment).  To accomplish this, the project makes use of year-round data from a large geographic area, i.e., Europe, to track migratory bird species and their habitat associations in their summer and winter ranges and along their migratory routes to determine when and where responses to environmental change are strongest, thus improving our ability to accurately forecast responses to environmental changes. This is a ""whole-life-cycle"" approach to assessing population health and is only now being explored by ecological researchers. The US component of the project focuses on developing computationally intensive machine-learning methods by investigators who have extensive expertise in working with very large citizen science data sets. The parts of the project carried out by scientists from other countries will be funded by those countries. This work will, in addition to anticipating consequences of physical conditions and anthropogenic land-use practices across Europe, aid in the development of new conservation strategies in response to environmental change, for example by identifying needs or opportunities to change the areas targeted for management actions such as habitat protection or restoration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance a 1995 heat wave resulted in over 600 deaths in Chicago, and the European heat wave of 2003 claimed more than 50,000 lives.  Heat waves also cause indirect harm by contributing to crop failures, wildfires, droughts, and poor air quality.  Heat wave frequency has increased dramatically over the past decades, accompanying the rise of global mean temperature, and further increases are expected as temperature continues to rise.  Warmer temperatures also lead to more ""concurrent heat waves"", meaning simultaneous heat waves that cover a substantial fraction of the summer hemisphere land surface.<br/><br/>Weather patterns leading to heat waves are easy to identify, commonly involving stagnant high-pressure systems accompanied by clear skies and subsiding air. But more perceptive analysis is required to understand why those weather patterns form, how long they remain in place, and the extent to which maximum temperatures within them are affected by the dryness of the surface or other local effects.  A further consideration is that heat waves are typically identified as prolonged periods of extremely hot weather, but high humidity can matter as much as high temperature for human health effects.  Compared to traditional heat waves the meteorology of humid heat waves is relatively unexplored.<br/><br/>Research conducted here considers the contributions of dynamic and thermodynamic processes to heat waves considering both dry and humid events.  A key consideration is the extent to which heat waves are prolonged and intensified by dry soil, which prevents evaporative cooling of the land surface. Another is the extent to which distinct physical mechanisms lead to dry and humid events, where humid events are defined as extremes of the wet bulb temperature (WBT). WBT is the lowest temperature that can be achieved through evaporative cooling given ambient temperature and moisture.  It is a good indicator of human heat stress as we rely on evaporation of perspiration to avoid heat stress at high temperatures.<br/><br/>One analysis tool is causal effect networks (CENs), a graphical technique borrowed from information theory and machine learning in which causality is established through lagged regression.  Preliminary work using CENs suggests that an early summer heat wave can lead to reduced precipitation, which dries the soil and promotes additional heat waves. The work is performed using a combination of observations and output from climate model simulations of present-day and projected future climate, and model simulations are devised to further test and examine physical mechanisms.<br/><br/>The work is of practical as well as scientific interest given the severe consequences of heat waves as noted above.  Outreach to stakeholders concerned with heat wave impacts is performed through the Consortium for Climate Risk in the Urban Northeast (CCRUN), where one of the researchers has a leadership role.  Interactions with students interested in climate impacts is enabled through the lead researcher's role as Director of the Masters degree granting Climate and Society program at Columbia University. The project also involves a Primarily Undergraduate Institution (PUI), and results are incorporated into undergraduate classroom teaching.  In addition, two graduate students are supported through this award.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Simulations of earth's climate thus require an approximate representation of these flows which is fast enough to be practical and accurate enough to capture phenomena of interest, such as the warming effect of carbon dioxide (CO2).  The development of such representations, referred to as radiative transfer parameterizations or more simply as radiation schemes, is challenging given that the transparency of the atmosphere to infrared radiation can vary abruptly from one wavelength to another. Practical radiation schemes exist, but they are challenging to develop and update and it is not generally feasible to tailor them to specific applications. For example the version of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) available in 2020 uses a radiation scheme published in 2008, despite the availability of new spectroscopic observations, and the same version is used for full-complexity present-day simulations and for idealized simulations that would benefit from a faster but less accurate version.<br/><br/>This award supports the creation of a toolkit that would greatly enhance the ability of climate researchers to create radiative transfer parameterizations suitable for their needs.  The user would supply a set of benchmark atmospheres, specified as profiles of temperature and composition (water vapor and CO2, for instance), that cover the range of conditions anticipated in the particular application, and the toolbox would use a sophisticated line-by-line radiative transfer model and a database of up-to-date spectroscopic observations to create parameterization options with varying degrees of accuracy and computational cost.  Users would then be able to choose the best trade-off between cost and accuracy for their application.  In addition, the project creates parameterizations for specific research goals: one for simulations of paleoclimates with high CO2 concentrations and two for studies of the interaction between radiation and convective clouds (one emphasizing speed, which can be invoked more frequently, and one emphasizing accuracy).  A third, developed with collaborators at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (funded through other sources), is optimized for simulations of present-day climate and prediction of climate fluctuations including El Nino events.<br/><br/>The project also includes work on alternative methods for parameterizing radiative transfer, one of which is a discrete frequency approximation, in which an optimally chosen set of strictly monochromatic spectral lines is used instead of a representation in terms of frequency bands.  The lines are determined from the spectral database using a fast optimization technique such as simulated annealing.  The second is a machine learning approach designed to emulate the underlying exact solutions to the radiative transfer equations.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts through the development of a key piece of infrastructure for weather and climate models.  The work will thus have benefit for the worldwide community that relies on these models as tools for basic science research.  Workshops and tutorials are supported to facilitate community engagement.  The work also enhances the value of model-based predictions and projections as guidance for decision makers concerned with climate variability and change. The project supports a postdoc and a graduate student, thus providing for the future workforce in climate model development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Air in the subtropics generally enters the region in the upper troposphere after ascending in the deep convective clouds found in the convergence zones near the equator.  The RH of the air is largely determined by the coldest temperature it encounters during in-cloud ascent, as condensation dries the air to the saturation moisture value given by its temperature (lower moisture content for colder air).  But other factors also influence the RH of the subsiding subtropical air, in particular the air can be moistened by mixing with air from more humid levels closer to the surface.  The same RH can be achieved either by a relatively warm last saturation temperature with little mixing or a relatively cold last saturation temperature followed by greater mixing,  The two pathways to the same RH can have different implications for cloud feedbacks and RH change in a warming climate.<br/> <br/>However, these two pathways can be distinguished by examining the relative concentrations of heavier isotopes of water vapor, water vapor in which one of the hydrogen atoms is replace by deuterium or the oxygen 16 atom is replace by oxygen 18.  Roughly speaking, the heavier forms of water vapor evaporate more sluggishly and condense more readily than ordinary H2O, an effect which depends on the temperature at which the evaporation or condensation takes place.  Thus, heavy isotopes contain important clues to understanding the processes which set subtropical RH and relate it to subtropical clouds and their climate feedbacks.<br/> <br/>With this motivation the PIs examine the isotopic concentration of water vapor in the subtropical mid-troposphere using satellite and ground-based observations as well as climate model simulations.  Ground-based observations include measurements taken by the lead PI on the Chajnantor Plateau in Chile (see AGS-1158582).  Much of the work is performed using an inverse modeling technique in which an optimal set of parameters (including last saturation temperature and vertical mixing, among others) is determined using a machine learning algorithm that mimics natural selection.  The inverse technique is advantageous in that it is computationally inexpensive and can be applied equally well to both observations and model output.<br/> <br/>The work has societal relevance as it can lead to a better understanding of the role of subtropical clouds in climate change, a central issue in efforts to anticipate the amount of warming caused by greenhouse gas increases.  In addition, the project includes an extensive education and outreach effort through the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science in Albuquerque.  The museum serves a large Hispanic and Native American population including both inner city and rural communities.  The effort engages elementary school students through a summer camp program, middle and high school students through a ""junior docent"" summer program, and middle and high school teachers through a professional development workshop.  In addition, the project provides support and training for a graduate student, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area."

Methane is a greenhouse gas whose impact on future climate warming will depend on emissions from both human sources and the changing natural environment. It is therefore critical to understand the baseline emission rates of natural methane sources to the atmosphere as well as their sensitivity to change. While the open ocean environment is thought to emit only minor amounts of methane to the atmosphere, concentrations and emission rates of methane increase substantially approaching coastlines. Coastal ocean methane emissions are potentially significant at the global scale but remain highly uncertain due to a lack of observations that accurately capture coastal distributions. Furthermore, the source of methane emitted from coastal surface waters is not well known, limiting our ability to predict how emissions will change in the future. This project will determine the source and global emission rate of methane from the coastal ocean to the atmosphere, and establish a framework to predict future emission rates in a warming climate. In addition to these scientific and societal impacts, this project will have strong educational impacts as it will provide undergraduate students the opportunity to experience the entire scientific process from idea conception to publication of the final results. A sequence of classes has been established by the PI at the University of Rochester to guide students through this process from an ocean science perspective. This project will serve as the focus for the next iteration of the class sequence, and participating students will be vital contributors to the research. When conducted previously, this educational outreach has empowered undergraduates to pursue their own scientific interests and has led to significant numbers of students pursuing graduate careers in the ocean sciences. This project will also support a Ph.D. student in a truly unique experience whereby she/he will have the opportunity to conduct meaningful research in both sea-going measurement as well as modeling laboratories, and thus integrate into two often disparate communities.<br/><br/>This project will be accomplished through a unique and equal combination of observational and statistical modeling work, leveraging methodologies that are well established in the PI and co-PI's laboratories to make rapid progress over the 2.5-year duration of the project. In total, surface methane concentrations in four coastal regions ""spanning three different ocean basins and subtropical to subpolar latitude ranges"" will be measured using an ultra-fast vacuum extraction method, yielding coastal data coverage that is unparalleled in previous datasets. Additionally, the radiocarbon content of surface methane will be measured to fingerprint its provenance between fossil and microbial sources, and biogeochemical data including chlorophyll, nutrient, and dissolved oxygen concentrations will be collected. Initial cruise data (year 1) will be used to train Artificial Neural Network models to predict surface methane supersaturation as a function of biogeochemical variables, and later cruises (year 2) will allow for independent model validation in regions that were not used for training. Having established the fidelity with which this model can generalize between coastal environments, it will be applied to extrapolate maps of methane supersaturation and estimate regional and global scale coastal methane emissions while quantifying their uncertainty. Overall, this work will close these gaps in our knowledge of the natural methane budget, yielding the most robust estimates to date of coastal ocean emissions and a new understanding of the mechanisms that sustain them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed efforts would re-open the HAARP observatory following its transition from military to civilian management at the University of Alaska. The planned work is also very well coordinated with measurements from an NSF-funded network of high-latitude radars. This proposal therefore represents a substantial opportunity to build infrastructure.

This heterogeneous character of natural faults is what makes earthquakes complex and difficult to predict. Some fault sections are mostly locked but recurrently host earthquakes. Other sections are creeping and generally stable. However, under poorly understood circumstances, earthquakes that nucleated in an unstable section can propagate far into stable fault sections and result in particularly large and destructive events. This project investigates the causes that lead to activation of the creeping fault sections by combining large-scale laboratory earthquake experiments with physics-based numerical simulations. The modeled fault consists of stable and unstable parts which realistically reproduce the mechanics of earthquakes at heterogeneous faults. A better understanding of the interaction between stable and unstable fault sections will help us evaluate the potential for extremely large earthquakes that will likely enhance existing seismic hazard assessment tools. This project is a benefit to society because it will help us to better understand earthquakes and develop tools to assess these hazards, and it will add to STEM education of students while supporting new researchers in earthquake studies.<br/><br/>This research is a collaborative effort to investigate the mechanics of earthquake rupture arrest with focus on heterogeneous fault properties. It combines multiscale laboratory experiments and numerical modeling. The experiments provide physical constraints for the numerical models, while the modeling improves understanding, generalizing, and scaling up the experimental results. Large-scale laboratory earthquake experiments are conducted on a biaxial machine that generates repeatable sequences of dynamic rupture events contained within a 3-m long granite sample. The fault surfaces are coated with gouge to generate patches of velocity-weakening and velocity-strengthening materials. To explore scaling effects, additional experiments are conducted on a 0.76 m tabletop biaxial machine using plastic samples as forcing blocks. Smaller-scale double-direct shear experiments will benchmark the frictional constitutive parameters of the gouge materials, an essential step for the interpretation of the larger-scale laboratory earthquake observations and the development of realistic, high-resolution numerical models of dynamic rupture and arrest. The simulations include sequences of slip events that quantitatively reproduce the relevant scales of the experiments including the actual size of the apparatus and the rupture process zone.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today, nearly 45% of all college students begin their undergraduate education at a community college; for underrepresented minority (URM) college students, the community college starting point is even larger (54%). These students are often underrepresented in the geosciences, underprepared academically, and burdened by unique obstacles due to socioeconomic status and family responsibilities. Few are aware of geoscience as a possible career.  If these students transfer successfully into a bachelor's degree program, they are often delayed in completion of their degrees because of inadequate math preparation and missing prerequisites, as well as the common necessity of working 20-40 hours/week to support themselves and their families. Many drop out of the pipeline, either because they are unable to complete the rigorous degree requirements or because they feel isolated and a sense of ""not belonging.""  Even if they complete their degrees, many of these students are first in their families to go to college and have little idea of how and when to plan for what follows graduation. To address these obstacles, this project is creating a seamless, supportive path from the time a student chooses a college major to when s/he enters graduate school or employment as a geoscientist. <br/><br/>This multi-campus partnership between Queens College, a 4-year college in the City University of New York (CUNY) system, and LaGuardia and Queensborough Community Colleges guarantees help for students from unusually diverse ethnic and economic backgrounds, regardless of where they first enter the education pipeline. Innovative strategies in this effort address transitions at four key points at which students make or confirm the decision to pursue a career in Geology or Environmental Science, or to drop out of the STEM pipeline: 1) Starting a geoscience career path at a community college; 2) Transfer from a 2-year to 4-year college; 3) Completing a rigorous geoscience major; and 4) Transition to graduate school or geoscience employment. Through customized workshops and outreach at the community colleges, students are building the skills needed for a science career and being provided with information about career options and salaries in the geosciences.  Coordinated multi-campus recruiting and advising by peers and faculty from all three campuses are helping students make strategic coursework choices that better articulate with the degree requirements at the 4-year institution.  A unique geoscience learning community spanning all three campuses is helping to make the transition from 2-year to 4-year seamless. New majors have an opportunity to mingle with advanced students and faculty from the Queens College campuses before and throughout the academic year at academic (colloquia, field trips) and social events. By the time they transfer from their community college, students know the Queens faculty and the best path to degree completion. Modest stipends are being provided that make possible a geoscience service-learning culture for superior students, saving travel to and from off-campus jobs unrelated to their career goals. Stipend recipients serve as teaching aides and tutors in introductory courses, helping others understand basic concepts while deepening their own understanding. Some tutees will become the next generation of geoscience majors and tutors. Because calculus is known nationally as one of the major obstacles to completing a geoscience degree, free tutoring is being provided by Time 2000, a Queens College initiative that trains students to become high school math teachers. To better prepare students for their lives after graduation, the project is offering a series of workshops, starting in the freshman year, that help individuals choose job or graduate school; write resumes, personal statements, and application letters; and learn interview skills.<br/><br/>The principal intellectual merit of this project is to test two innovative models for improving student engagement, academic performance, and retention: 1) a unique discipline-specific learning community spanning three urban campuses - two Associates (community college) and one Bachelor's-Master's college, and 2) a service-learning approach to engaging students that removes or lessens the need of financially challenged geoscience majors to work off-campus at jobs unrelated to their professional goals.  Although the ""Freshman Year to Geoscience Career"" project is designed specifically to increase the number and diversity of geoscience students at the participating CUNY system campuses, the problems it addresses are endemic and the solutions it offers can serve as a model across all academic institutions and disciplines."

The STEM Student Experiences Aboard Ships (STEMSEAS) project is a 3-year partnership between the Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, and the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) aimed at addressing three priorities: (1) increasing the number and diversity of students pursuing degrees and careers in geosciences; (2) preparing students for all possible career trajectories in the geosciences; and, (3) contributing to the evidence base for effective student engagement, learning and retention in STEM. The STEMSEAS project is achieving these goals by taking advantage of unused berthing capacity available on UNOLS vessels as they transit between U.S. ports in preparation for their next scientific expedition. These short (~5-7 days) transits offer a unique mobile classroom setting where undergraduate non-STEM, undecided-STEM, and geoscience majors can be exposed to geoscience professional practice and career exploration. By partnering with UNOLS and campus ?champions"" at universities, including minority-serving institutions (MSIs) and historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), the project sends diverse cohorts of students to sea with a small team of geoscience faculty and mentors. STEMSEAS is built on a pilot-project that sent three cohorts (~10 undergraduate students each) selected from an applicant pool of ~875 students on three different research vessels during 2016. The pilot-project demonstrated the logistical feasibility of the program, and showed through preliminary data a strong potential for positive impact. While at sea, the students engage in a variety of hands-on activities that incorporate geoscience content, lab exercises, data collection/analysis, career exploration, and discussion/reflection.

Application materials and evaluation surveys are providing data to assess the impact of the STEMSEAS project on student knowledge of and attitudes toward the geosciences and geoscience careers. The STEMSEAS project is designed to add to the evidence base regarding what kinds of experiences and interventions help to increase retention and persistence in geoscience-related majors, and what strategies are most effective at increasing the number and diversity of students entering the geoscience workforce pipeline. By creating innovative learning experiences on board charismatic research vessels, STEMSEAS is gathering data on the effectiveness of novel approaches for engaging students who may never have considered the geosciences as a field of study or career, students who are interested in the geosciences but are unsure of what direction to go, and STEM-interested students who may not have considered the specifics of the geosciences. Through these immersive experiences, STEMSEAS is exploring the effectiveness of short-term but intense learning activities."

As part of Binghamton University's Freshman Research Immersion (FRI) program, a team of five science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) faculty across the geology, biology and environmental studies disciplines are using the multi- disciplinary field of biogeochemistry to engage students early in their college years in research applicable to geoscience careers. Biogeochemistry investigates the interconnection of biological, geological, and chemical processes. Modern and ancient lake and ocean sediments, the atmosphere, watersheds and wetlands provide field sites and samples for the biogeochemistry research. The biogeochemistry research stream consists of a three course sequence: 1) a research methods course during the fall semester, 2) followed by training in analytical techniques during the spring semester that 3) culminates in completion of a research project the following fall.  Funding is being provided for some of the FRI students to engage in hands-on, outdoor, field based components of their research projects during the summer between the spring and fall. This approach allows students to develop projects that incorporate and evaluate seasonality components critical to the understanding of many biogeochemical processes.  As a part of the outreach program, high school educators and several of their students participate in a summer workshop where they learn about FRI opportunities through direct interaction with the FRI students, faculty and staff. In turn, the FRI students and their achievements are being used to develop an outreach program that includes visits to high schools and community colleges. Consequently, this program is working to increase the numbers and diversity of students trained in Geosciences, thus meeting a crucial national need within a STEM discipline.<br/><br/><br/>The Freshman Research Immersion (FRI) program is supporting a cohort of 25-30 Biogeochemistry students each year. The biogeochemistry experience begins with a research methods course that emphasizes quantitative reasoning, scientific communication and a semester-long literature review to identify research topics in biogeochemistry. The first half of the spring semester, students learn analytical techniques applicable to biogeochemistry research; by the second half of the spring, they begin their research project. In the fall of sophomore year, students have an entire second semester to continue working on their research project. The biogeochemistry stream has a dedicated laboratory equipped for research, and a PhD-trained research educator who oversees the students, graduate teaching assistant and undergraduate peer mentors.  The FRI program features a combination of the multiple components. A team of faculty members with well-established research programs designs and oversees the freshman research themes.  The research themes explicitly address core concepts and core skills of the geosciences.  The participating freshmen develop electronic-portfolios documenting their research experiences and understanding of the process of science, which they build upon throughout their college years.  Students take a sequence of courses that emphasize teamwork, thus provides explicit training to undergraduates on how to work in research teams.  The students are exposed to interdisciplinary research (IDR) and engage in multiple opportunities to develop IDR skills. The biogeochemistry research projects generate spin-off research modules that are being infused into other courses; as a result, authentic research experiences eventually will be provided in regular science courses, contributing to improved engagement, learning and retention in the sciences. The undergraduates' research activities are expected to result in students being co-authors of presentations and peer-reviewed articles. Assessment activities are documenting the impacts of the stepped, multi-mentored research experience of the FRI program for undergraduates considering a career in geosciences."

The growing geoscience job market will present exciting new opportunities to contribute to the sustainability and well being of society; however, for a variety of reasons, students are not being made aware of these opportunities. The problem is particularly acute among underrepresented minority (URM, or Black, Hispanic, American Indian/Alaskan Native) students. This program applies a novel multi-level approach of engaging students at different stages in their education in a five week summer research project related to the challenges of living sustainably on Long Island. Four teams each year made up of an undergraduate science major, a high school student, and a future science teacher will perform hands on research closely mentored by expert faculty. The ultimate goal is to increase the number of students (particularly those underrepresented in the STEM pipeline) pursuing geoscience related degrees and planning on entering geoscience professions. In addition, the program seeks to strengthen the ability of future teachers to inspire students and influence their future STEM learning and interest in STEM careers, and to raise awareness among teachers of the research opportunities in the geosciences. <br/><br/>Part 2 - During an intensive 5 week program, GEOTeam members will engage in collaborative, authentic, scientific inquiry on projects that focus on hydrogeology, sedimentology, geohazards, climate, and biogeochemistry. Weekly seminars and workshops will introduce students to research processes, safety training, and career development through interaction with geoscience professionals from local governments and businesses. GEOTeams will present their work and results in professional settings such as science fairs, conferences, and public meetings. The project capitalizes on several outstanding Hofstra programs, including the Summer Science Research Program; a STEM Collaboratorium; established connections with area public schools, particularly high need schools; the STEP and CSTEP collegiate preparatory programs for underrepresented students; and the Noyce Scholars Program. The project provides new insights on engaging students raised in a developed environment with limited exposure to geology a significant topic which has not yet received adequate attention. It adds to the knowledge base on how the strategic use of team?\based learning rooted in a collaborative process can impact the performance of students, particularly underrepresented students, in geoscience. It enhances the infrastructure for science teacher education by improving science teachers' ability to advance student learning through authentic research. <br/><br/>The project explores how universities can directly engage high school students in explorations of geoscience early in their studies before they lose interest. Finally, project findings should contribute to [best practices] in STEM instruction for underserved minority students and increase their self\efficacy and performance in mathematics and science, thus expanding their opportunities for STEM careers. The students' engagement in authentic, career\relevant geoscience experiences will give them a concrete understanding of key knowledge and skills in the field and the importance of geoscience in solving real world problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are not directly accessible due to their depth of formation, or because these magmas have long since solidified, leaving behind minerals.  Thus, the chemistry of the resulting minerals need to be used as proxies, to determine the physical and chemical characteristics of these magmas and fluids.  One key variable that remains poorly explored in the accessory group of minerals (e.g., zircon, monazite, and apatite) is the oxygen ""pressure"" of the magma or fluid from which they crystallized.  The goal of this research is to calibrate and understand how the chemistry of these minerals changes in response to changes in the oxygen pressures.  These calibrations will take place in a laboratory setting enabling the synthesis of minerals under precision-controlled conditions. Such experiments will serve as stepping stones to explore the formation environment of natural minerals.  The accessory minerals zircon, monazite, and apatite are specifically targeted because they are excellent recorders of absolute time.  This is so because they structurally accommodate radioactive elements such as uranium and thorium.  Thus, changes in the oxygen pressure of a magma can, for example, be explored as a function of time.  Oxygen pressure is an important variable in Earth studies because it influences mineral saturation and stability (including economically important minerals) and the viscosity of magmas.  Because of this, quantifying the oxygen pressure of past systems, including ancient volcanic systems, will lead to new knowledge to that may help explain why volcanoes erupt.  Second, the types of volatiles present during an eruption depends on oxygen pressure, and meaning that magmatic outgassing throughout Earth history has partially influenced the composition of our atmosphere.  Third, this research will explore the stability of these minerals in the presence oxidized fluids.  Monazite, for instance, is a major host of light rare earth elements, thorium, and uranium in the crust. Understanding the stability and solubility of this mineral will also help researchers explore the mobility of these key heat producing and economically important elements (rare earth elements are found in almost all modern electronics manufactured today). And finally, minerals (zircons) older than 4 billion years represent a key target for application because rocks from this time period are either sparse or altogether absent. This work will therefore result in new knowledge about the environments and conditions that may have prevailed on the earliest Earth.  <br/> <br/>Oxygen fugacity buffered experiments will be conducted in piston cylinder devices at the University of Rochester.  In many cases, experimental products will be analyzed by a Laser Ablation Inductively Couple Plasma Mass Spectrometer (LA-ICP-MS; also at the University of Rochester) by the PI, graduate, and undergraduate students.  This will provide key training for undergraduates and graduate students in techniques involved in mineral synthesis and mass spectrometry, with applications that extend well beyond the geology/mineralogy field.  (LA)-IPC-MS instruments have been used in medical research, biology, chemistry, and materials science, so students will come away with a useful skill set applicable across the STEM fields.  In addition, students will receive training in X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) techniques; this work will be undertaken at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory.  The practical training will result in a broad skill set, highly applicable to many areas within and outside the geosciences.  The broader impacts of this project come from several activities that implement active learning.  This award will enable a partnership with NSF-Funded Noyce program awarded to the Warner School of Education at the University of Rochester.  The PI will work with selected K-12 math and science teacher fellows in high-need urban districts in upstate New York - current graduate rates are below 50% - to increase science literacy, to create a better understanding of the different manners in which people learn, to expose teachers to new and evolving methods of teaching, and to create learning experiences that are more interesting, meaningful, and effective for their students.  And finally, the PI will design a new course to explore teaching strategies that have been demonstrated to be effective when compared to a traditional lecture.    The course will also be built around a research problem identified in this proposal.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Judicious management of the U.S. Science Support program will enable the U.S. scientific community to maximize the scientific return from the IODP drilling platforms and address the major themes outlined in the IODP Science Plan for 2013-2023. These include monitoring past climate and ocean change; pursuing greater understanding of subseafloor organisms and ecosystems; examining connections between Earth's surface environment and deep processes; and increasing our understanding of geohazards such as earthquakes, landslides, and tsunamis. Scientific ocean drilling remains one of the preeminent tools for reconstructing Earth's history and improving predictive models for its future. IODP also provides a means whereby young investigators and graduate students can work alongside experienced scientists who will serve as mentors and leaders. The results obtained from IODP will constitute an important data set that should inform social policy in the coming decades. In addition, USSSP-IODP will pursue a comprehensive outreach program with the goal of increasing the public's awareness of IODP's accomplishments. Outreach efforts will include family learning opportunities and the use of traditional media and Internet-based initiatives such as social media. As much as possible, LDEO will bring IODP scientists into direct contact with the public through the use of ship-to-shore video, online interviews and Q&A sessions, and special outreach events at museums and other informal learning centers. Through collaboration with the American Museum of Natural History, an estimated 15,000 family visitors over five years will attend IODP-related lectures as part of the Millstein Science Series, after which they will interact with IODP researchers and museum-based educators on IODP-specific activities. In addition, the multidisciplinary nature of IODP makes it an ideal platform for STEM education development and initiatives. USSSP-IODP will promote STEM learning by engaging teachers at all levels in IODP-related professional development programs and providing them with the opportunity to sail on the JOIDES Resolution as part of the School of Rock or the new Onboard Program. <br/><br/>LDEO has a long involvement with scientific ocean drilling and the collective experience of the PI and co-PIs provide a strong foundation that will ensure the office is managed efficiently and with an eye toward providing superior service to the U.S scientific community. USSSP-IODP will support numerous components of the U.S. IODP effort, including travel costs for program development and planning, expedition participation and pre-and post-drilling activities. Salary support for U.S. scientific party members on both the JOIDES Resolution and non-U.S. drilling vessels will also be provided. The LDEO and Columbia administration groups have extensive experience with establishing subawards and are well positioned to provide these services on behalf of the USSSP-IODP. The reorganized U.S. Science Advisory Committee (USAC) will coordinate or provide reviews of proposals and applications from the U.S. IODP community and will provide the implementing organizations with recommendations for shipboard staffing. USAC will also advise USSSP-IODP in establishing goals for U.S activities in IODP, promote the development of working groups and individual drilling proposals, and provide oversight of the USSSP Office."

The primary objective of the NEPARS REU site is to provide learning opportunities to a promising and diverse group of undergraduates which will help them prepare for careers in STEM fields by conducting quality scientific research, building professional networks, improving leadership skills, and developing effective communication skills.  Each year a cohort of 12 undergraduate students will be offered paid summer research positions with the NEPARS REU to work with faculty mentors from Hobart & William Smith Colleges (HWS) and Plymouth State University (PSU). Six students and three mentors will work at each research location during a 9-week summer research program. Additionally, the NEPARS REU will partner with the Mt. Washington Observatory and the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences at SUNY Albany to offer interactions beneficial to REU student professional development. The NEPARS REU site has a primary focus on participation of rising sophomores and rising juniors that have just completed their first and second year, respectively, at two-year or four-year colleges and universities across the U.S. offering degrees in STEM fields. <br/><br/>The REU site will be structured so that students work in pairs with a mentor.  This will allow the students to develop experience working as part of a research team, while they will also learn autonomy of research with their own individual project within the team.  Modern technology, such as video-conferencing, will be leveraged so that students can communicate across the two locations.  The REU site has 4 objectives for students: 1) interact with, learn from, and conduct research investigations with their peers and dedicated mentors through the use of REU pairings and a REU cohort across two research locations, 2) explore and discover the social, cultural, and geographic diversity of others with comparable academic interests from similar or vastly different colleges and universities, 3) cultivate a greater understanding of atmospheric and related sciences beyond the extent taught in the undergraduate classroom and lab, including the development  and enhancement of research skills while working with observational and modeling datasets, and 4) develop effective leadership and communication skills through a series of workshops and opportunities to interact with professionals within the scientific community.  Additionally the REU site has developed two objectives for the REU mentors: 1) increase interactions between two primarily undergraduate institutions to strengthen the respective programs and support new, as well as existing, faculty research collaborations, and 2) enhance faculty development as undergraduate mentors through training, faculty-to-faculty mentoring, and by working with a diverse student population from a variety of academic institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project?s emphasis on model-based learning (MBL) provides pre-service Earth Science Education (ESE) majors with authentic research experiences designed to enrich content expertise and provide new avenues for improving student learning in high school geoscience classrooms. The insights gained through all aspects of the project will benefit geoscience educators specifically and science education professionals more broadly. Presentations and workshops at science teacher conferences will further broaden the project?s impact by exposing a large group of K-12 teachers to the benefits of using models of Earth processes created through the project. Pre-service participants who conduct these presentations will experience greater self-efficacy and begin to view themselves as both scientists and teachers of science.

For each year of the three-year project, a cohort of pre-service Earth Science teachers will design and build new models of Earth processes and concepts. Models are especially effective in Earth Science because so many geoscience processes and concepts operate on spatial and temporal scales that are difficult for students to grasp. Models developed by participants will be evaluated by New York State Master STEM Teachers and pilot-tested in K-12 and introductory geoscience college classes. Models will also be presented in ?Science Saturdays,? in informal science education venues, and at science teacher conferences. Through the design and construction of new models to help K-12 students conceptualize various Earth concepts, ESE majors will gain valuable insights into the nature of science and engineering design, which are important threads in the Next Generation Science Standards. These experiences will enable participating ESE majors to stimulate interest in the geosciences in K-12 students, with the ultimate goals of inspiring students to choose geoscience majors in college, and eventually reducing the deficit of geoscientists in the workforce."

Guided pathways in community colleges are a set of strategies that offer students highly structured learning experiences in which they are provided with clear academic and professional goals, cohesive academic programs, and aligned support services to assist them along program paths. Community colleges in the CUNY system have been chosen as the focal point because while they offer strong potential for diversifying our STEM workforce, low persistence in degree completion/transfer rates to 4-year institutions remains a challenge. For the Geosciences, the diversity challenge is magnified even further, creating a critical need to not only recognize this disparity, but to engage in conversations and activities that strengthen the multiple pathways into the Geosciences, including those from community colleges. Community college students who are not retained in the Geosciences represent a loss of talent and investment. The consortium has an opportunity to demonstrate that these well-connected networks have an important role to play in bringing diversity into our research communities and promoting inclusive excellence. <br/><br/>Part 2<br/>This three-year project will use a collective impact framework and follow the guided pathway model to community college education. The PIs intend to study how a collective group can design and implement guided pathways into the Geosciences for community college students and strengthen awareness, interest, and ultimately recruitment and matriculation into geoscience majors at four-year institutions within CUNY. PIs hypothesize that by creating a consortium around a common goal, bringing together key representatives from community colleges, and introducing components of guided pathways specifically for the Geosciences, students will begin to better understand the field, but more importantly, how they can navigate their way through the multiple pathways into it. Rather than create a one-size-fits-all guided pathway in the Geosciences across CUNY's community colleges, the project aims to design elements (i.e. course sequences and maps, learning outcomes, and transfer procedures) of guided pathways, which can be integrated over time into existing programs and departments. The work of the consortium will provide evidence for how a set of research-based design principles and strategies to support students, particularly for the Geosciences, can yield stronger outcomes for recruiting students into the field and ultimately the workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, groundwater extent, flow, and processes on a continent virtually locked in ice are poorly understood. The proposed work investigates the interplay between groundwater, sediment, and ice in Antarctica's cold desert landscape to determine when, where, and why Antarctic groundwater is flowing, and how it may evolve Antarctic frozen deserts from dry and stable to wet and dynamic. Mapping the changing extent of Antarctic near-surface groundwater requires the ability to measure soil moisture rapidly and repeatedly over large areas. The research will capture changes in near-surface groundwater distribution through an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) mapping approach. The project integrates a diverse range of sensors with new UAV technologies to provide a higher-resolution and more frequent assessment of Antarctic groundwater extent and composition than can be accomplished using satellite observations alone. To complement the research objectives, the PI will develop a new UAV summer field school, the Geosciences UAV Academy, focused on training undergraduate-level UAV pilots in conducting novel earth sciences research using cutting edge imaging tools. The integration of research and technology will prepare students for careers in UAV-related industries and research. The project will deliver new UAV tools and workflows for soil moisture mapping relevant to arid regions including Antarctica as well as temperate desert and dryland systems and will train student research pilots to tackle next generation airborne challenges.  <br/><br/>Water tracks are the basic hydrological unit that currently feeds the rapidly-changing permafrost and wetlands in the Antarctic McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV). Despite the importance of water tracks in the MDV hydrologic cycle and their influence on biogeochemistry, little is known about how these water tracks control the unique brine processes operating in Antarctic ice-free areas. Both groundwater availability and geochemistry shape Antarctic microbial communities, connecting soil geology and hydrology to carbon cycling and ecosystem functioning. The objectives of this CAREER proposal are to 1) map water tracks to determine the spatial distribution and seasonal magnitude of groundwater impacts on the MDV near-surface environment to determine how near-surface groundwater drives permafrost thaw and enhances chemical weathering and biogeochemical cycling; 2) establish a UAV academy training earth sciences students to answer geoscience questions using drone-based platforms and remote sensing techniques; and 3) provide a formative step in the development of the PI as a teacher-scholar. UAV-borne hyperspectral imaging complemented with field soil sampling will determine the aerial extent and timing of inundation, water level, and water budget of representative water tracks in the MDV. Soil moisture will be measured via near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy while bulk chemistry of soils and groundwater will be analyzed via ion chromatography and soil x-ray fluorescence. Sedimentological and hydrological properties will be determined via analysis of intact core samples. These data will be used to test competing hypotheses regarding the origin of water track solutions and water movement through seasonal wetlands. The work will provide a regional understanding of groundwater sources, shallow groundwater flux, and the influence of regional hydrogeology on solute export to the Southern Ocean and on soil/atmosphere linkages in earth's carbon budget. The UAV school will 1) provide comprehensive instruction at the undergraduate level in both how and why UAVs can advance geoscience research and learning; and 2) provide educational infrastructure for an eventual self-sustaining summer program for undergraduate UAV education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Anthropogenic radioisotopes are unstable forms of elements that have a human-made origin; they may leak into the environment as by-products of nuclear weapons testing or nuclear energy production.  In common with other multinational initiatives in the International GEOTRACES program, the goals of the U.S. Arctic expedition are to identify processes and quantify fluxes that control the distributions of key trace elements and isotopes in the ocean, and to establish the sensitivity of these distributions to changing environmental conditions.  Results from this research will help to characterize distinct contaminant sources for anthropogenic radioisotopes and identify the influence of important mechanisms that lead to their observed distributions in the Arctic.  Researchers will collaborate with the NSF-funded Polar Learning and Responding Climate Change Education Partnership in order to develop web-based spatial tools for sharing results of their work with students and the general public.<br/><br/>Although a significant amount of work has been done in the Arctic, data sets on radionuclides are entirely lacking in some cases or limited with respect to particular elements or isotopes of interest including characterization of different sources, water column, sea ice, and sediments. The U.S. GEOTRACES Arctic section offers an unprecedented opportunity to study the sources, fate and transport of anthropogenic radionuclides in the Arctic, a region that has been heavily impacted by nuclear industrial activities and exhibiting dramatic and rapid responses to global climate change. Using a comprehensive, multi-tracer approach, these researchers will determine the concentrations of a suite of anthropogenic radionuclides, including cesium-137, cesium-134, plutonium-239, plutonium-240, and neptunium-237 in a variety of different types of samples from the Arctic. This study will provide information on the horizontal and vertical distributions of the anthropogenic radionuclides of interest, which will substantially add to the global data set, constrain the budgets of several anthropogenic radionuclides through collaboration with European colleagues, and address not only the transport and fate of these contaminants in the Arctic, but also provide insight into the dominant processes that affect them. The data will support efforts in data modeling, which will integrate the dissolved and particulate anthropogenic radionuclides data on a basin-wide basis, and then compare and evaluate the contributions from different oceanic processes as well as the influence of sources of contamination."

Learning about this evolution is extremely difficult because the memory of this evolution is in rocks but almost all of them have been recycled in our dynamic Earth. An exception are ocean islands (e.g. Hawaii, Galapagos) that are formed by upwellings (mantle plumes) from the core-mantle boundary and represent material that witnessed surface conditions of the Earth a long time ago. But how long ago? This is generally not yet known. Although the age of a volcanic rock can be measured, the age of the source of a volcanic rock cannot. A recently developed tool to address this question looks at sulfur. The atmosphere changed about 2.45 billion years ago when oxygen increased dramatically, the so-called Great Oxygenation Event. The composition of sulfur in contact with the atmosphere before and after this 2.45 billion year mark are very different. Thus it can be determined if sulfur was on the surface of Earth before or after 2.45 billion years ago. Previous studies have found that sulfur from the surface of Earth more than 2.45 billion years ago traveled to the core-mantle boundary some 3000 km deep and back up where it was carried in magmas to the surface. This is an excellent example how the surface of our planet shapes its interior all the way down to the core. In this project sulfur will be used for the first time to investigate one of the major plume systems that have formed flood basalts covering most of Brazil about 130 Ma ago followed by lines of volcanoes marking the passage of the plates over a stationary mantle plume. This project will constrain the age of the source of this major plume system to younger or older than 2.45 billion years. It will also help our understanding how volumetrically significant material older than 2.45 billion year-old material is in the formation of mantle plumes. It has surprised researchers that mantle plume sources can be so old. It is exciting to look at a volcanic eruption and know that what forms lava today had been at the surface of Earth when no higher life forms yet existed, traveled all the way to the core-mantle boundary, and came back up over more than half of Earth's history. <br/><br/>The persistence of recycled surface sulfur through subduction and eventual rise in a mantle plume has been demonstrated for two smaller South Pacific plumes (Pitcairn and Mangaia island of Cook-Austral) with basalts including sulfur older than about 2.45 Ga. However, to this point it is not clear whether such old surface material is a common or rare component in plume sources. In this project for the first time sulfur isotopes are measured in rocks related to a major long-lived plume system, the Tristan-Gough plume system in the South Atlantic, with an initial flood basalt province, the Parana, and with a root at the core-mantle boundary related to the African large low shear wave velocity province. This project addresses the following major hypothesis through a detailed analyses of sulfide inclusions in volcanic rocks from Tristan and Gough island: 1. Is the recycled component in the Tristan-Gough plume of Archean age or younger? Previous work showed that the Gough signature persists since at least 100 Ma, thus an Archean age would indicate that a significant volume of a major plume source contains old recycled surface material. 2. How does the absence or presence of Archean sulfur relate to the global endmembers of oceanic basalts in Sr-Nd-Hf-Pb isotopic compositions? Pitcairn and Tristan-Gough both have enriched mantle 1 endmember compositions. Do sulfur isotopes support formation by similar geochemical fractionation events of similar age, or, do different evolution paths lead to similar compositions? 3. What do sulfur isotopes imply regarding contributions from atmospheric, deep ocean hydrothermal or even microbial sediment components?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fluid motions in the photosphere provide power for the waves, but the precise excitation mechanism is yet unknown.  Once excited, the wave energy must be transmitted to the corona.  However, recent observations have shown that the interface region between the photosphere and corona (i.e., the chromosphere and transition region) is complex. Thus, it is known how wave energy propagates through the interface region.  These issues hinder the development of coronal heating models, which are limited by our poor understanding of the wave properties at the base of the corona.  To tackle these important science problems for solar physics, this three-year project will use data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer (IRIS) to measure the properties of waves in the interface region of the solar atmosphere.  The main science objectives of the project are to: (1) identify where plasma waves are generated; (2) determine how wave energy propagates from the photosphere to the corona; and, (3) specify the wave boundary conditions at the base of the corona.<br/><br/>During this three-year research project, archival data from IRIS will be analyzed to address the following three major issues.  First, determine where MHD waves are generated.  It is currently unknown whether waves are generated mainly in the photosphere and propagate up through the interface region or whether the waves are generated within the interface region.  The photosphere exhibits various fluid motions that can generate waves, such as the buffeting of magnetic field lines by granular motions.  But, the waves can be reflected by the strong density gradients at the transition region and so not reach the corona.  Global acoustic p-modes at the photosphere could launch acoustic waves, but they must undergo mode conversion if they are the source of the Alfvenic waves observed in the corona.  Alternatively, waves may be generated in the chromosphere, for example, by reconnection.  The IRIS data will be used to determine the wave modes and sources and sinks of wave power through varying heights in the interface region and thereby identify signatures of these processes and other possible ones.  Second, measure the propagation of waves from the photosphere into the corona.  Wave reflection and damping may prevent much of the wave power from reaching the corona.  This project will determine how waves are transmitted through the interface region by observing the propagation of waves along structures and by measuring the power spectrum of the waves.  These measurements will then be compared to existing observations and spectra of lower lying photospheric fluctuations and of Alfvenic waves in the higher lying corona.  The analysis will determine where Alfvenic waves are reflected, if there is conversion of wave power from longitudinal to transverse modes or vice versa, and where wave energy is dissipated.  Results will be compared to theories for the propagation, reflection, and damping of waves throughout this complex region.  Third and final, characterize the wave modes and power at the base of the corona in order provide the critical boundary conditions needed for models of coronal heating.  By comparing the amplitudes and phases of velocity and intensity fluctuations one can constrain the relative contribution of compressible versus incompressible waves.  IRIS has sufficient spatial resolution to see torsional oscillations and thereby estimate the Alfvenic wave energy content of torsional versus kink waves.  By studying the power spectrum of the waves, it will be determined whether the fluctuations are already turbulent at the base of the corona or whether the turbulence develops in the corona at larger heights.<br/><br/>This research project will have broader impacts through postdoctoral training and public outreach.  The project will train a postdoctoral research scientist in the field of solar physics and in techniques for the analysis of spectroscopic observations.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Snail larvae swim up with more effort or sink in response to cues from waves and turbulence, and it remains unclear whether larvae can use these physical cues for retention within or navigation among habitats.  Larvae that swim up under waves may be retained over the continental shelf by wave-induced shoreward drift in surface waters. However, ocean warming causes larvae to be released earlier in spring when waves are larger and coastal upwelling is weaker, potentially carrying larvae into shallower waters that exceed the adults' temperature tolerance. The investigators will use a physical model of the Middle Atlantic Bight and adjacent estuaries to test hypotheses about how waves and turbulence affect transport patterns, retention near adult habitats, and climate-induced shifts in adult distributions. The project will produce simulations of ocean circulation and larval tracking codes that include waves both as behavior cues and as a transport mechanism; these products will be made publicly available. A graduate student will do a related dissertation. Undergraduate students will be involved through an NSF-funded REU program, the Aresty Program, which engages Rutgers' diverse undergraduates in research to boost retention in STEM majors, the Rutgers Research in Science and Engineering program, which targets underrepresented minorities, and the Skidmore Summer Research program. Model outputs will be used to develop learning materials for undergraduates, packaged as a case study for distribution through the National Center for Case Study Teaching in Science. Research results will also be presented to adult (55 and over) learners through the Skidmore Encore lecture series.<br/><br/>Waves are unique in providing planktonic larvae with a behavior cue directly tied to a horizontal transport mechanism, and newly discovered larval responses to waves could have counter-intuitive impacts on larval transport and species distributions.  Wave climates differ in the adjacent habitats of two congeneric snails: Tritia obsoleta occupies turbulent inlets and estuaries where waves are small, while Tritia trivittata occupies the continental shelf where waves are much larger. These two species' larvae sense waves and turbulence separately as acceleration and vorticity-induced body rotation, respectively. Late-stage estuarine larvae mainly exhibit turbulence-induced sinking that could reduce transport out of inlets and estuaries, whereas shelf larvae also exhibit wave-induced upward swimming that could aid retention over the shelf via Stokes drift.  Since the 1960s, the shelf species' range has shifted into warmer water, opposite to predictions based on thermal tolerance. This shift may be driven by wave-induced larval transport; as ocean warming induces earlier spawning, larvae will encounter larger waves and weaker upwelling in spring, intensifying Stokes drift and onshore transport toward warmer, shallower waters of the inner shelf. The project will use numerical models to test hypotheses linking flow-induced larval behaviors to transport pathways, local retention, and climate-driven range shifts. Waves will be included as a source of both behavior cues and advection through acceleration and Stokes drift, respectively.  Results will help resolve uncertainties about how Stokes drift, Eulerian return flow, and upwelling interact to transport larvae. Numerical experiments will describe how climate-driven changes in spawning phenology affect larval transport, potentially identifying the mechanism behind perplexing range shifts of shelf species into warmer water.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Alaskan subduction system is one of the best places in the world to study these processes, because earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are large and frequent. It has generated more magnitude 8+ earthquakes during the past century than any other subduction zone in the world, as well as thousands of small earthquakes that will allow the research to produce geophysical ""sonograms"" of the Earth's crust, mantle and beneath its volcanoes. There is also much systematic variability in earthquake and volcano behavior, which has been hypothesized to be influenced by the tremendous variability in the nature of the Pacific tectonic plate which subducts here beneath Alaska. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions have significant impacts on the security and well-being of regional populations; eruptions impact trans-Pacific air travel and transport, and tsunamis from this region are focused toward Hawaii and the west coast of North America so pose a danger to a large population. Our understanding of these hazards is severely hampered by a lack of seismometers in the region that produces these events -- thus the need to deploy seismometers onland and particularly offshore. This is a community experiment: after completion of the data collection, all data will be made immediately available to the broader scientific community to spur discovery and innovation. Understanding the relationships between the observed earthquakes and the physical properties of interacting plates will enhance our ability to characterize seismic and volcanic hazards in Alaska, as well as globally in similar geologic settings. The data and project will provide a fertile training ground for the next generation of earth scientists in a broad range of disciplines.<br/><br/>The selection of Alaska as a GeoPRISMS primary site, deployment of Alaskan EarthScope Transportable Array (TA) seismic stations, and the recent development of a large pool of both shallow and deep-water ocean bottom seismographs (OBSs) provide a unique opportunity to advance understanding of subduction zones. This project funds onshore and offshore seismicity data collection and rapid release to the community. The deployment will include 75 broadband OBSs and 30 land broadband sensors, recording for 15 months in 2018-19. The array covers a broad area that spans the incoming plate, the megathrust and volcanic arc to the distal backarc, and includes a dense transect in the Kodiak/Katmai region. When integrated with the TA, the array extends 1500 km from incoming plate to the Arctic coast and spans 700 km along strike. The OBSs include 20 shielded sensors for deployment in shallow water. All shallow-water and nine deep-water instruments will include absolute pressure gauges to capture possible slow slip events, while five OBSs and six land sites will include accelerometers to record large local earthquakes without clipping.<br/><br/>The project is likely to revolutionize our understanding of subduction zones. Much of the Alaskan subduction system is dominated by megathrust events, hosting more M>8 events in the past century than any other subduction system, yet some sections show aseismic creep. It also hosts a world-class magmatic arc displaying a range of systematic along-strike variations in chemistry and a subducting plate exhibiting along-strike variations in hydration, structure, and sediment thickness. The proposed experiment is designed to provide a critical data set addressing several broad questions: (1) What changes in seismic properties cause variation in seismic coupling, the occurrence of great earthquakes and aseismic creep on subduction megathrusts? (2) Is the subducting uppermost mantle hydrated and what controls variations in hydration along strike? (3) What controls variations in volcanic arc crust/mantle structure, volcanic composition and the geometry of the arc melt production region? (4) How does the flow and volatile release generated by subduction zones interact with large-scale plate flow and the evolution of sub-continental mantle?<br/><br/>Data collected by this community experiment will be made publically available immediately via the IRIS Data Management Center, allowing the geophysical community to use them in research of fundamental questions about subduction processes as well as seismic and volcanic hazards. Experiment design was constructed to leverage contemporaneous deployment of the Alaska TA to encourage maximal use of both datasets. During three cruises, graduate students and early to mid career scientists will be selected to join the science crew, learning about OBS data collection, to encourage the widespread use of the data from new sectors of the community. During the fourth cruise, a group of ten undergraduates will join the science team following a five-day intensive preparatory short course. An additional 10 undergraduate students from Alaskan universities will participate in the workshop. To extend the educational opportunities of this experiment to local communities, two K-12 teachers from Alaskan or Native schools will be selected to participate in OBS deployment cruise and use their experiences to design lesson plans for public distribution. The 10-member PI team was chosen through an open application process and includes multiple early-career scientists benefitting from this leadership opportunity."

Decades of study on subduction zones have provided insight into the overarching processes that produce the magmas erupted, how the erupted magmas are produced at individual volcanoes, and a number of related questions. Despite this progress, a complex and largely unsolved problem is the cause of ubiquitous and dramatic variations in the amount and composition of magmas that erupt at volcanoes within the same subduction zone. Do these reflect processes acting deep within the Earth?s mantle, or in the overlying crust? Addressing this problem has important implications for understanding magma production and volcanic hazards, as worldwide almost a billion people live at risk from volcanoes. There is also a potential for scientific breakthrough by utilizing the existing large data sets acquired from recent NSF investments such as the MARGINS, GeoPRISMS, and EarthScope programs. However, addressing the question has proven challenging to date in part because of a lack of critical data for some locations, but largely because of the lack of suitable tools and approaches that allow us to quantitatively synthesize and compare the existing large data sets. <br/><br/>Thus, this is a multidisciplinary study to conduct a quantitative comparison of existing large geophysical and compositional datasets at the spatial scales of the entire Cascades subduction zone, linked through sets of common intensive variables such as heat and density, to determine the primary drivers of intra-arc magmatic diversity. Building on a successful Proof of Concept project that demonstrates the promise of the approach (Till et al., 2019), the project will test hypotheses about the relative roles of mantle magmatic flux vs. crustal characteristics and crustal magma storage depths in producing variations in erupted compositions and fluxes, and in controlling the geophysical state of the crust along strike in the Quaternary Cascades arc. The project has the potential to transform our understanding of these important regions and will produce a number of important broader impacts including, catalyzing interdisciplinary collaborations between three PI?s at three institutions, producing expert datasets widely and easily available to the Earth Science community, supporting undergraduate experiential learning activities.

The recent burial of 231Protactinium (Pa) in sediments of the North Pacific Ocean is observed to be in near balance with its production in the overlying water column. In contrast, the few existing longer sedimentary records suggest that significantly less 231Pa was buried than produced during past ice ages, raising the possibility of changes in biological productivity, ocean currents, or ocean chemistry. This project will produce high quality datasets from past time intervals to investigate changes in the sedimentary 231Pa budget and explore these oceanographic possibilities, using an array of deep-sea sediment cores from across the North Pacific. The resulting data will be used to test hypotheses regarding the distribution and burial of 231Pa in the ocean and to provide insights into past changes in biological productivity, chemical oceanography, and ocean circulation. The project will promote training and learning for students at multiple different educational levels. A graduate student will play a central role in the research, gaining technical training and professional development.<br/><br/>Sedimentary 231Pa/230Th is a widely utilized proxy that can provide valuable insight into circulation, surface productivity and hydrothermal activity in the modern and past ocean. Although the modern 231Pa budget in the North Pacific appears to be in balance, almost twice as much 231Pa is buried along the basin margins than in the open ocean today. The few recently generated records from the Northeast Pacific suggest that this major sink along the margins may not have been in effect during the last ice age. In fact, 231Pa burial in the Northeast Pacific appears to vary in tandem with changing climate conditions, with excess burial only occurring during interglacial periods. This project will provide a systematic, quantitative assessment of how the North Pacific 231Pa budget has evolved over the last glacial cycle. The study will generate 231Pa/230Th time series and productivity records from each of the major biogeographic provinces in the Pacific, including the open ocean gyre and surrounding continental margins, to assess how the biogeochemical cycles of the Pacific Ocean have evolved over time. These data will determine whether and where the apparently missing marginal 231Pa was buried during the last glacial period, evaluate the mechanisms that drove this shift, and assess how the spatial distribution of 231Pa burial may have evolved over time.

It is thereby probable that parts of the Earth's crust and mantle are partially molten even though they are dominantly solid. The goal of this proposal is to improve the understanding of the relationship between the state of partial melting and changes in elastic properties of the media.  The focus will be the upper mantle of the Earth.  Since elastic properties quantitatively define the speed that seismic waves propagate through the media, the results of this research will enable better associations between maps of seismic speed variations and degrees of partial melting.  The approach of this program is to probe the physics and chemistry basics of melting and mechanics yielding a deeper understanding of the underlying principles in order to provide a robust model that can then be applied to a wide variety of environments.   While the focus of the proposal is the upper mantle region of the Earth, an improved model will also be relevant to the crust.  Indeed, the results could also have applications in defining this relationship in industrial settings in detecting incipient stages of melting of various materials.  This program provides a cutting-edge learning experience for students including graduate students in the preparation of their PhD and undergraduate students in the focus of a summer research project.  The results will be used throughout the Earth sciences as fundamental information on the behavior of the Earth's interior.  The tools that are developed will be made available to other researchers for studying strength related properties of materials.  These tools (software and hardware) will immediately become part of the COMPRES-operated synchrotron facility and available to all in the community that wish to use them.  The tools developed here will be useful for studying material properties under extreme environments and will be useful to develop better industrial materials.<br/><br/>The authors have recently demonstrated that the current models of the mechanical properties of solid/melt combinations are inadequate and have proposed that the interaction between the solid and melt has a significant effect on the elastic properties.  The new model, ""dynamic melting,"" changes the predicted effect of melting on the relationship between the bulk modulus and the shear modulus. In the dynamic melting model, the kinetics of melting introduces a change in the frequency dependence of the elastic properties.  The current proposal is to carefully test the dynamic melting model by studying a broader range of chemistry of the material and alter the experimental conditions and protocols in order to compare the predicted changes with the experimentally observed changes.  The experiments are made possible by new high pressure capabilities on multi-anvil high pressure apparatus installed at synchrotron light sources.  These systems enable the generation of pressure and temperature of the upper mantle on samples that can then be axially compressed, with the synchrotron yielding images of the sample with very high precision measurements of length, and diffraction profiles that yield state of stress.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When char interacts with water, some of it dissolves and is carried away by rivers to the ocean.  This soluble component of char is termed ""dissolved black carbon"" (DBC).  Recent research has revealed DBC to be a major component of the carbon cycle.  Most notably, DBC is now known to make up 10% of all dissolved organic carbon that rivers carry to the sea.  Once in the ocean, DBC remains there for thousands of years, storing carbon that would otherwise be in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.  As carbon dioxide contributes to the greenhouse effect, with higher carbon dioxide in the atmosphere leading to warmer global temperatures, it is important to understand where DBC in the ocean came from and how long it will stay locked away in the deep ocean.  In this funded work, we set out to determine the source of the DBC in the ocean.  Based upon our previous work that shows rivers export massive amounts of DBC to the coast, it has been suggested that rivers are the main source of DBC to the open ocean.  However, in looking more closely at the DBC in rivers and the oceans, we found them to differ in one critical way: they have different isotopic signatures.  This precludes them from having the same source, indicating that the DBC in the oceans is not from rivers.  Our preliminary work only looked at a small river in Georgia, USA, and in the coastal waters offshore.  In this funded project, we will take a global look at the isotopic signatures of DBC collected from large rivers such as the Amazon, Mississippi, and Yukon, and from the middle of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  If we find there is no overlap in the isotopes of the DBC from these major global rivers and ocean waters, we can conclude that rivers are not the main source of oceanic DBC and will need to search for new explanations of how molecules produced by fire end up in the deep ocean.  <br/><br/>The project will enhance the career and continue the training of a first-time investigator and train undergraduate students in real world research through the Northeastern University Cooperative Program.  In addition, our findings be adapted to produce learning materials for high school students in collaboration with the Science Journal for Kids.<br/><br/>Previous efforts to track DBC sources in natural waters have come with major limitations, preventing definitive connections to be made between oceanic DBC and its pyrogenic source.  Photodegradation, a significant removal process for DBC in surface waters, drastically alters the molecular composition of DBC and erases any potential link between DBC chemical composition and its source.  Bulk stable carbon isotopic measurements cannot unambiguously identify sources of DOC subcomponents, such as DBC.  As such, this project aims to constrain the oceanic source of DBC by measuring compound-specific stable carbon isotopes of molecular markers (benzenepolycarboxylic acids, or BPCAs), derived exclusively from DBC.  Our preliminary data show BPCA-specific isotopic values to have a sufficiently wide dynamic range between riverine and oceanic samples to test our hypotheses.  In the current proposal, we aim to 1) isotopically characterize the largest quantified flux of DBC to the ocean (global rivers), 2) assess in situ oceanic variation in DBC stable carbon isotopic signatures, and 3) investigate the potential BPCA-specific fractionation effects of DBC photodegradation.  In establishing a robust tracer for DBC source, we will be able to accurately constrain sources of oceanic DBC and further investigate the biogeochemical cycling of DBC across the terrestrial-marine continuum.  The results of our research will also assist in answering larger research questions, specifically those regarding the fate of terrigenous DOM in the ocean, which have plagued biogeochemists for decades.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The timing of onset can vary considerably from year to year, thus skillful onset predictions would be valuable for agricultural planning.  But the predictability of Spring onset, and the processes that lead to year-to-year differences in onset date, are not well known. Research conducted here addresses both issues.  <br/><br/>The onset is clearly linked to local meteorological factors such as sunlight, warmth, and rainfall, but preliminary work by the PI and collaborators suggests that onset indicators such as the leaf-out of lilacs have greater predictability than the associated meteorological variables.  The predictability of such phenological indicators based on the observational record is thus a focus of the research. The predictability of the associated meteorological conditions is also a target of the research, addressed using long-range forecasts from the National Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) project. Onset predictability is further analyzed through a new crowdsourced retrospective forecasting project, in which the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is configured for personal computers and disseminated to local high school students.  Students create WRF forecasts using different versions of the model physics, thereby accounting for uncertainties inherent in the forecast model. Further work on ensemble prediction compares ensemble forecast skill to a baseline provided by a simple empirical linear inverse model (LIM).  The LIM comparison determines the advantage of using complex nonlinear forecast models over statistical methods based on past behavior, and tests the hypothesis that the predictable dynamics of the transition are essentially linear.<br/><br/>The changes in local meteorology that control the timing of leaf-out and other phenology are in turn controlled by a reorganization of the large-scale atmospheric circulation that occurs rapidly in Spring.  In particular, the splitting and northward migration of the jet stream over the central and eastern Pacific have been identified as a key factor.  The dynamics of the jet transition are examined using a hierarchy of models of varying degrees of complexity, including a global atmospheric model with prescribed realistic sea surface temperatures (SSTs), the same model with the landmasses removed and simplified sea surface temperatures, and a linear baroclinic model.<br/><br/>The educational component of this CAREER award involves the use of WRF as a tool for teaching weather and climate science to students in 20 regional high schools.  The PI works with the Paleontological Research Institution's Museum of the Earth (MoE) to conduct training workshops for teachers on the use of the WRF model as a teaching tool. The workshops emphasizes learning by doing, interactively showing the teachers how their students can set up and run the model, make daily forecasts for nearby weather stations, and validate the forecasts the following day.  In addition, the educational activities are an integral part of the research activity, as the WRF forecasts produced by the students are collected into ensembles used for research on spring onset predictability.  Aside from the educational broader impacts, the research has broader impacts due to the potential value of skillful predictions of spring onset, which would benefit farmers and other decision makers in the agricultural sector.  The project provides support and training to a graduate student and a postdoc and summer support for an undergraduate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When water in the rooting zone is limited, trees undergo physiological changes that affect their overall growth and health. This problem is particularly acute within forests in river floodplains in regions with warm, dry summers (e.g., large areas of the USA). Such forests provide a range of ecosystem services, but they are limited in area, species diversity, and are challenging to manage under a changing climate. This project aims to build new understanding of the ?ecohydrological? links between water availability and forest health by employing an interdisciplinary set of research methods. It involves extracting tree cores from floodplain trees to investigate annual growth and will further investigate the ?isotopic signatures? of source water used by trees as recorded within each annual ring. By also monitoring climate variations and collecting water from various contributing sources, the project will provide insight into variations in potential source waters to forest trees. To generalize this research, the research will employ a numerical model to assess how climate controls water access to forests under plausible scenarios of regional climate change. The project will generate: new tools and information for practitioners of forest/water/basin management, international educational opportunities for underrepresented groups in the hydrologic sciences, and a new ecohydrology course for undergraduates.    <br/>This research project combines: 1) field-based measurements of climate and hydrology and laboratory analysis of oxygen isotopes from all potential tree water sources; (2) contemporary and retrospective analysis of oxygen and carbon isotopes in annual tree-rings to investigate recent climate-driven fluctuations in tree water use and water use efficiency; (3) seasonal (intra-annual) analysis of oxygen isotopes via high-resolution ?micro-slicing? of annual tree rings to assess seasonal fluctuations in tree water source use; and 4) improvement and application of a climate-driven numerical ecohydrology model that includes dynamic water fluxes into the floodplain, isotopic fractionation/mixing, and tree water uptake. It will compare the ecohydrologic responses to climate in water availability at forest sites along a strong climatic gradient. <br/>There is currently limited ability to link tree/forest response to decadal climate shifts. Generalizable understanding linking regional climate to water availability to water use by riparian trees across forests stands is currently lacking, which limits predictive capability of forest response to drought stress over decadal timescales. This research will enable: i) identification of signatures of water stress within riparian forests; ii) predictive capability of forest response to climate change; iii) a clearer picture of regional variations in the expression of climate within floodplain water availability; and iv) improvement of dendro-paleoclimate reconstructions by providing better constraints on water availability and use under different conditions of climatic forcing. <br/>This research project will provide managers with a new perspective and tools for anticipating and mitigating the risks of climate change on vulnerable riparian forest resources along major rivers in temperate and Mediterranean climatic regions. The project will host a 2-day workshop to disseminate our findings to practitioners and stakeholders in in the study region. It also includes a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) supplement to enable two female and/or minority students to travel to France as their first international trip to participate on the first field campaign. The REU will provide these students will an exciting international research experience, a world-class learning opportunity, and an introduction to a potential career in environmental/hydrologic sciences. Additionally, data and models from this research will be integrated into a new upper division course on dryland ecohydrology at UCSB. <br/>"

Thanks to new satellite and in situ observations, powerful numerical models, and advances in theory, it is now understood that ocean mesoscale turbulence, the highly energetic, nonlinear jumble of waves, eddies, and jets which characterizes ocean currents on scales of 20-500 km, is an essential component of ocean circulation, transport, and marine ecosystems. Because this turbulence draws its energy from instabilities of the large-scale flow, its properties are themselves sensitive to changes in climate. This project seeks to answer the question: how, and on what timescales, do large-scale changes in global climate affect the properties of ocean mesoscale turbulence? As such, the proposed work has the potential to transform how the climate community views mesoscale turbulence. Because most ocean climate models are too coarse to resolve the mesoscale, the effects of mesoscale turbulence are parameterized. As a result, mesoscale turbulence is reduced to a ""parameter"" to be tuned, rather than an emergent, dynamic part of the Earth system. The project is aimed at deepening basic physical understanding of the processes that regulate the properties of mesoscale turbulence and the timescales on which these properties respond to changes in climate. Consideration of this two-way interaction will lead to a richer understanding of the role of the ocean in the climate system, opening the door to new mechanisms for climate feedbacks. The project will also lead to methodological advances in Big Data computational tools for oceanography. The curriculum development will address the need for students to develop strong computational skills and, in particular, the capability to handle Big Data, to meet the emerging challenges of 21st century science. It will also promote active learning and the use of data in the oceanography classroom. The open-source nature of the teaching materials will encourage wide adoption. Strong interaction between research and education is guaranteed, because the same tools used in the research will be incorporated into the curriculum, both evolving together throughout the project.<br/><br/>The research component of this CAREER award will examine the link between climate change, baroclinic instability, mesoscale eddy properties (kinetic energy and length scales), and mesoscale mixing, using a hierarchy of models and observations. Idealized process models will build a theoretical foundation of understanding of how changes in surface wind and buoyancy forcing lead to changes in mesoscale turbulence. Decadal variability in mesoscale statistics and baroclinic instability will also be examined in satellite and hydrographic observations. Finally, the theoretical framework and statistical analysis will be applied to global, eddy-resolving climate model simulations of greenhouse warming. To facilitate this work, Python-based computational tools for rapid data processing will be developed. These tools will be integrated into education through development of an open-source curriculum in ""Big Data Oceanography,"" in which the computational skills necessary to study global, high-resolution datasets are taught side-by-side with core ocean science concepts. These modules will be deployed and assessed in an undergraduate course and disseminated widely online and at education conferences."

As such, the possibility exists that these anaerobic reactions are more widespread than previously thought and could play a significant role in the cycling of sulfur, nitrogen, and some trace metals.  Researchers from the University of California-Los Angeles and the University of Washington plan to study these reactions by developing a particle-redox model to simulate the biogeochemistry of anaerobic microenvironments and make predictions which can be tested against available ocean data (GEOTRACES program).  The study is intended to understand the conditions needed to cycle nitrogen and sulfur in these particle microenvironments, the scavenging of trace metals during sulfide precipitations, and develop a tracer for particle bound denitrification (removal of nitrogen by microbes).  This project will be the first funding support for two tenure-track faculty who are dedicated to education and public outreach to help broaden involvement in ocean sciences. One of the investigators will be involved as a youth educator in the ""Students on Ice"" program which conducts workshops that allows youth to gain experience at sea learning about oceanography, whereas the other would organize a series of workshops to engage students from the Rochester City School District in science.<br/><br/>This project seeks to investigate the evidence that has been coming out in recent years that anaerobic microenvironments within organic particles are widespread throughout the ocean and are a significant contributor to denitrification and sulfur reduction rates in otherwise oxygenated waters. To do so, the researchers plan to develop a new modeling framework to simulate the biogeochemistry of anaerobic microenvironments and make predictions which can be tested against available observations such as those from the GEOTRACES program.  Overall the objectives of this research are to (1) understand the water column conditions and particle properties that lead to these anaerobic microenvironments, (2) test whether sulfate reduction rates are consistent with the metal precipitation signatures known for low oxygen water, and (3) predict the geochemical signature of particle bound denitrification and determine its rate from the large-scale distribution of nitrogen tracers.  Understanding the anaerobic processes taking place within anaerobic microenvironments of organic particles in the water column is likely to update the biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen, sulfur, and trace metals."

Within the phytoplankton, the diatoms conduct nearly half of this photosynthesis, exerting profound control over global carbon cycling. Despite their importance, there are surprisingly fundamental gaps in understanding how diatoms function in their natural environment, in part because methods to assess in situ physiology are lacking. This project focuses on the application of a powerful new approach, called Quantitative Metabolic Fingerprinting (QMF), to address this knowledge gap and examine species-specific physiology in the field. The project will provide transformative insights into how ocean geochemistry controls the distribution of diatoms, the metabolic responses of individual diatom species, and how metabolic potential is partitioned between diatom species, thus providing new insights into the structure and function of marine systems. The overarching goal is to examine how diatom species respond to changes in biogeochemistry across marine provinces, from the coast to the open ocean, by following shifts in diatom physiology using QMF. This research is critical to understand future changes in oceanic phytoplankton in response to climate and environmental change. Furthermore, activities on this project will include supporting a graduate student and postdoctoral fellow and delivering the Artistic Oceanographer Program (AOP) to diverse middle school age children and teachers in the NYC metropolitan area and to middle-school girls in the Girl Scouts of RI, reaching an anticipated 60 children and 30 teachers annually. The programs will foster multidisciplinary hands-on learning and will directly impact STEM education at a critical point in the pipeline by targeting diverse middle-school aged groups in both NY and RI.<br/><br/>In laboratory studies with cultured isolates, there are profound differences among diatom species' responses to nutrient limitation. Thus, it is likely that different species contribute differently to nutrient uptake, carbon flux and burial. However, marine ecosystem models often rely on physiological attributes drawn from just one species and apply those attributes globally (e.g. coastal species used to model open ocean dynamics) or choose a single average value to represent all species across the world's oceans. In part, this is due to a relatively poor understanding of diatom physiological ecology and a limited tool set for assessing in situ diatom physiological ecology. This research project will address this specific challenge by explicitly tracking metabolic pathways, measuring their regulation and determining their taxonomic distribution in a suite of environmentally significant diatoms using a state of the art, species-specific approach.  A research expedition is set in the North Atlantic, a system that plays a major role in carbon cycling. Starting with a New England coastal shelf site, samples will be collected from the coast where diatoms thrive, to the open ocean and a site of a long term ocean time series station (the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series) where diatom growth is muted by nutrient limitation. This research takes advantage of new ocean observatories initiative (OOI) and time series information. Through the research expedition and downstream laboratory experiments, the molecular pathways of nutrient metabolism and related gene expression in a suite of environmentally significant diatoms will be identified. Data will be combined to predict major limiting factors and potentially important substrates for diatoms across marine provinces. Importantly, this integrated approach takes advantage of new advances in molecular and bioinformatics tools to examine in situ physiological ecology at the species-specific level, a key knowledge gap in the field."

Recent research on social vulnerability, particularly the vulnerability of communities to extreme natural events based on social factors such as income, race, ethnicity, and housing, finds that communities of color are often among those most vulnerable to these natural events. To address this challenge head-on, the Ambassadors for STEM Training to Enhance Participation (A-STEP) program will provide a transformative seagoing experience to cohorts of students from underrepresented communities who will be equipped with both solid science background and science communication skills. This experience will broaden perspectives on the role of the oceans as a driver of global and environmental change and is expected to empower ambassadors to communicate that change within their own diverse communities.

Under the guidance of instructors and science mentors, these students will become effective ambassadors to disseminate exciting and relevant geoscience information across broad audiences.  <br/> <br/>The goals of the A-STEP project are to: (1) Raise the profile of geosciences and geoscience-related careers among under-represented groups nationwide; (2) Produce a series of engaging multimedia products to contribute towards this goal; (3) Draw from scientific ocean drilling and related research to develop educational storyboard modules aimed at K-12 audiences showing the impacts of global change on marine and terrestrial systems; and (4) Contribute to increased diversity of knowledge across geoscience-related fields and career choices by drawing greater attention to the relevance of climate and environmental change for all citizens.<br/>To achieve these goals, cohorts of 16 students annually from talented pools of STEM and non-STEM majors will join scientists and science education/communication professionals on short transit cruises on the JOIDES Resolution and UNOLS vessels. Students will learn first-hand in the scientifically-rich environment of an oceanographic cruise the significance of data gleaned from marine sediments, marine organisms, marine pollution, water chemistry, weather and climate patterns, and seafloor dynamics. Subsequently, these newly-minted ambassadors will be deployed across their communities and the nation to transmit the importance and relevance of geoscience information and careers, create innovative products and presentations about their experiences, and make linkages between climate and environmental change and people's daily lives. A-STEP cohorts will become a rich nationwide resource for inspiring the next generation of geoscientists. As ambassadors tasked with promoting STEM knowledge and careers, program participants will bring meaning and value to information, demonstrating how climate and environmental change is affecting all citizens, urban and rural. Citizens with few direct connections to science and scientists, who unfortunately are disproportionately African American, Latino, and Native American communities, are often more vulnerable to misinformation and will especially benefit from interactions with A-STEP students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The HSZ displays marked changes in seismicity and plate-slip along its length: to the south the plates appear to be locked and have the capacity to generate great earthquakes whereas to the north the plates are creeping and regularly host episodic slow slip events and the occasional tsunami earthquake. The physical conditions controlling this contrast in plate coupling is not well understood. Recent investigations suggest fluids may play a critical role. To delineate whether fluids act as a primary control on the style of slip expressed along the HSZ, this study will use electromagnetic (EM) methods to image the electrical resistivity structure of the HSZ. Our measurements will provide important constraints on the hydrologic architecture by quantifying the along and across-strike variations in porosity and the fluid budget of the HSZ. This project will support a Ph.D. student and several graduate students, postdocs and early career scientists will be involved in the field work. The PI is an early career scientist who will gain valuable experience leading the field project and mentoring a graduate student. Additionally, a marine EM short-course will be given for students and unfunded collaborators to learn about marine EM theory, applications, data processing, and inverse modeling.<br/><br/>This project will use newly proven marine EM imaging technology to constrain the porosity and fluid budget of the crust and mantle along both segments of the HSZ. The survey cruise will deploy a grid of ocean-bottom EM receivers in a 400 km by 150 km area that spans the incoming plate and fore-arc margin. Magnetotelluric (MT) response functions will be estimated from the recorded electric and magnetic field time-series. In addition, controlled-source EM (CSEM) data will be recorded by deep towing a horizontal electric dipole transmitter near the seafloor along three trench-crossing transects located in the southern, central, and northern segments of the HSZ. The MT and CSEM data will be inverted for electrical resistivity and used to quantify the porosity structure across the margin. The HSZ resistivity results will be interpreted in conjunction with existing and planned geophysical and drilling data to test the hypothesis that along-strike variations in seismicity and interplate locking are related to the fluid budget of the incoming oceanic plate, fluid content along the plate interface, and upper plate permeability/porosity structure. The MT data will also image the electrical resistivity of the lithosphere and asthenosphere, providing independent constraints on the origin of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Students work in LDEO's lively interdisciplinary research and education communities and are individually mentored by at least one of LDEO's 180 PhD-level scientists. The goals of the program are for students to learn through their own experience what research is like, so they can explore research careers; for students to develop self-confidence in their independent research and communication abilities and scientific identities, by their coming to understand cutting-edge issues and contributing to their solution; and for them to form lasting professional relationships with scientists. Research projects are in all areas of the Earth, atmospheric, oceanic and environmental sciences and follow the diverse disciplinary interests of the students. <br/><br/>Professional development efforts include the three day Cutting Edge Workshop, held at the beginning of the program, which has the goal of teaching students to rapidly assess the purpose, methodology and logic of a scientific paper and to think critically about its importance.  Students also participate in Fire Safety Training, Lab Safety Training and Title IX training, a Computing Orientation workshop, a weekly scientific lecture series, a Research Ethics workshop, a scientific writing workshop and a career workshop. Students will be housed in dormitories at Columbia University in New York City, but they will work at LDEO, traveling to and from via bus each day. Students will also be introduced to the capabilities of the LDEO computing environment, and especially to data analysis, database access and the display of data (e.g. on maps). Most of the funding provides support for student stipends, housing and student travel to attend the program. The program conducts a national search for applicants and seeks to engage students who are from schools with limited research opportunities. This program supports the national goal of developing the next generation of scientists and the scientific workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Water trapped between the plates is thought to play an important role in controlling friction along the plate boundary and may explain large variations in earthquake activity along the Alaska Peninsula. This study will collect seafloor electromagnetic geophysical data to image the distribution of water in the sediments and crust along the plate boundary, with the goal of understanding how the transport and release of water in this critical region may regulate earthquake behavior and plate slip. This project will advance electromagnetic imaging as a new tool for studying subduction zones, and one that will help to image fluid volumes in key areas of the megathrust fault. The project supports the training of undergraduate and graduate students at sea where they will learn how to collect and analyze marine electromagnetic data.<br/><br/>This project will use new marine electromagnetic (EM) imaging technology to study the fluid content of the crust and mantle along the Semidi and Shumagin sections of the Aleutian-Alaska subduction zone. These sections of the subduction system have markedly different seafloor fabric entering the subduction zone trench and commensurately different seismicity. Data from a 2011 active seismic survey at this location show variations in sediment thickness and crustal fracturing along the incoming plate but are not able to fully constrain the amount and distribution of fluid. Passive and active EM data will be collected during a month-long cruise at 160 ocean-bottom stations along three trench-crossing profiles and one along-strike profile. Controlled-source EM data will image the electrical conductivity of the sediments and crust, while passive magnetotelluric data will map deep crustal and upper mantle conductivity. Together these data will constrain the hydration state of the incoming plate at the trench outer-rise, the distribution of fluids along the plate-interface beneath the forearc, and the release of fluids into the overlying forearc crust. The new EM data will be interpreted in conjunction with the existing seismic survey results to: (1) test the hypothesis that along strike variations in seismicity and plate locking are related to the fluid content of the incoming oceanic plate, which in turn is related to the pre-existing fabric in the plate and the orientation of this fabric with respect to the trench; (2) image and quantify fluids released from sediment dehydration along the surface of the down-going plate; (3) image and quantify zones of over-pressurized fluids and hydrofacturing of the overriding plate related to fluid release from the slab; (4) compare the conductivity structure at the Aleutian-Alaska subduction zone with a similar profile at the Middle America Trench, an end-member system where seafloor faults are aligned parallel to the trench, potentially maximizing fluid-flux into the system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our proposal will measure organic carbon isotopes of microscopic fossils that represent our best window into the evolution of life before the rise of animals. These measurements will help us figure out where in the oceans early organisms were living and if early life could thrive in waters with little to no oxygen. This work will involve undergraduate students in every aspect of the research, analysis, and writing. We will create new geochemical and paleontological educational modules for K-12 and college educators, develop innovative organic geochemistry techniques that will be shared with the broader scientific community and add information on early fossil life to the open-access Paleobiology Database. <br/><br/>While we have learned a significant amount about the Proterozoic Earth system in the last few decades, major questions remain, especially about the interplay between biology and the rise of atmospheric oxygen. One window into the biological record of the Proterozoic is via organic carbon isotopes, which track the isotope systematics of fixed carbon. However, these measurements are almost always done on bulk samples that represent the entire biological community time averaged into a sedimentary sample, which limits our ability to use these measurements to reconstruct short-term carbon cycle dynamics and to probe the structure of ancient ecosystems. Recent advances in NanoEA-IRMS now allow us to reliably measure the carbon isotopic composition of a single organic microfossil and compare that value to the bulk 13C. We seek to use this new technique to explore how organic carbon isotopes can illuminate two persistent unknowns in the Proterozoic Earth-life system: 1) What were the habitats and metabolisms of early eukaryotes? and 2) What can single microfossil carbon isotopes reveal about the controls on bulk carbon isotopes in the Proterozoic stratigraphic record and what do these records tell us about the Proterozoic Earth system?. We will approach these questions by analyzing bulk, kerogen and fossil organic carbon samples from four richly fossiliferous units that span the history of Proterozoic eukaryotes. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this proposal include continued development and refining of stable isotope analysis techniques, and integration of the Proterozoic microfossil record into the open-access Paleobiology Database. The proposal team will involve undergraduate students in all aspects of the research, and undergraduates will be meaningfully involved in data collection and interpretation. The team will also develop new educational activities for both high school and college-level audiences.

This knowledge of past water table fluctuations will help illuminate the regional rainfall response to climate variations, and strengthen predictions by providing rigorous tests of rainfall models. <br/><br/>The method is based on the demonstrated fact that heavy gases settle to the bottom of the stagnant column of air in the soil above the water table depth.  The deeper the water table, the more extreme the enrichment of heavy isotopes, and these heavy isotopes become dissolved in the water thus preserving information about the water table depth in aquifers containing ancient groundwater.  This groundwater is already routinely sampled to learn about past temperature from the abundance of the noble gases; the proposed research will add water table depth to the information that can be extracted from the samples."

The geologic record of Earth's past offers a glimpse of what could be in store for the future.  Research by Ivany and her team looks to Antarctica during a time of past global warmth to see how seasonality of temperature and rainfall in coastal settings are likely to change in the future.  They will use the chemistry of fossils (a natural archive of these variables) to test a provocative hypothesis about near-monsoonal conditions in the high latitudes when the oceans are warm.  If true, we can expect high-latitude shipping lanes to become more hazardous and fragile marine ecosystems adapted to constant cold temperatures to suffer.  With growing information about how human activities are likely to affect the planet in the future, we will be able to make more informed decisions about policies today. This research involves an international team of scholars, including several women scientists, training of graduate students, and a public museum exhibit to educate children about how we study Earth's ancient climate and what we can learn from it.<br/><br/>Antarctica is key to an understanding how Earth?s climate system works under conditions of elevated CO2. The poles are the most sensitive regions on the planet to climate change, and the equator-to-pole temperature gradient and the degree to which high-latitude warming is amplified are important components for climate models to capture. Accurate proxy data with good age control are therefore critical for testing numerical models and establishing global patterns. The La Meseta Formation on Seymour Island is the only documented marine section from the globally warm Eocene Epoch exposed in outcrop on the continent; hence its climate record is integral to studies of warming. Early data suggest the potential for strongly seasonal precipitation and runoff in coastal settings.  This collaboration among paleontologists, geochemists, and climate modelers will test this using seasonally resolved del-18O data from fossil shallow marine bivalves to track the evolution of seasonality through the section, in combination with independent proxies for the composition of summer precipitation (leaf wax del-D) and local seawater (clumped isotopes).  The impact of the anticipated salinity stratification on regional climate will be evaluated in the context of numerical climate model simulations.  In addition to providing greater clarity on high-latitude conditions during this time of high CO2, the combination of proxy and model results will provide insights about how Eocene warmth may have been maintained and how subsequent cooling came about. As well, a new approach to the analysis of shell carbonates for 87Sr/86Sr will allow refinements in age control so as to allow correlation of this important section with other regions to clarify global climate gradients.  The project outlined here will develop new and detailed paleoclimate records from existing samples using well-tuned as well as newer proxies applied here in novel ways. Seasonal extremes are climate parameters generally inaccessible to most studies but critical to an understanding of climate change; these are possible to resolve in this well-preserved, accretionary-macrofossil-bearing section. This is an integrated study that links marine and terrestrial climate records for a key region of the planet across the most significant climate transition in the Cenozoic."

The effects of these stressors on coastal marine organisms remain poorly understood because most research to date has examined the sensitivity of species to one factor, but not to more than one in combination. This project will determine how a model fish species, the Atlantic silverside, will respond to observed and predicted levels of dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen (O2). Shorter-term experiments will measure embryo and larval survival, growth, and metabolism, and determine whether parents experiencing stressful conditions produce more robust offspring. Longer-term experiments will study the consequences of ocean acidification over the entire life span by quantifying the effects of high-CO2 conditions on the ratio of males to females, lifetime growth, and reproductive investment. These studies will provide a more comprehensive view of how multiple stressors may impact populations of Atlantic silversides and potentially other important forage fish species. This collaborative project will support and train three graduate students at the University of Connecticut and the Stony Brook University (NY), two institutions that attract students from minority groups. It will also provide a variety of opportunities for undergraduates to participate in research and the public to learn about the study, through summer research projects, incorporation in the ""Women in Science and Engineering"" program, and interactive displays of environmental data from monitoring buoys. The two early-career investigators are committed to increasing ocean literacy and awareness of NSF-funded research through public talks and presentations. <br/><br/>This project responds to the recognized need for multi-stressor assessments of species sensitivities to anthropogenic environmental change. It will combine environmental monitoring with advanced experimental approaches to characterize early and whole life consequences of acidification and hypoxia in the Atlantic silverside (Menidia menidia), a valued model species and important forage fish along most of the US east coast. Experiments will employ a newly constructed, computer-controlled fish rearing system to allow independent and combined manipulation of seawater pCO2 and dissolved oxygen (DO) content and the application of static and fluctuating pCO2 and DO levels that were chosen to represent contemporary and potential future scenarios in productive coastal habitats. First CO2, DO, and CO2  DO dependent reaction norms will be quantified for fitness-relevant early life history (ELH) traits including pre- and post-hatch survival, time to hatch, post-hatch growth, by rearing offspring collected from wild adults from fertilization to 20 days post hatch (dph) using a full factorial design of 3 CO2  3 DO levels. Second, the effects of tidal and diel CO2  DO fluctuations of different amplitudes on silverside ELH traits will be quantified. To address knowledge gaps regarding the CO2-sensitivity in this species, laboratory manipulations of adult spawner environments and reciprocal offspring exposure experiments will elucidate the role of transgenerational plasticity as a potential short-term mechanism to cope with changing environments. To better understand the mechanisms of fish early life CO2-sensitivity, the effects of temperature  CO2 on pre- and post-hatch metabolism will be robustly quantified. The final objective is to rear silversides from fertilization to maturity under different CO2 levels and assess potential CO2-effects on sex ratio and whole life growth and fecundity."

More specifically, the presence of a discrete volatile phase (gas bubbles) affects the transport of a wide variety of metals in and out of magma bodies leading to ore deposit formation and controls the likelihood of an eruption as well as eruption dynamics. Unfortunately, erupted volcanic deposits or exhumed magma bodies have lost most traces of their volatile cargo; so, information about the timing of exsolution and the efficiency of volatile migration in active magma reservoir remain therefore elusive. The proposed study addresses this gap in knowledge with a combination of field work, mechanical models and laboratory experiments focusing on the behavior of volatiles in shallow magma reservoirs. <br/><br/>The main challenges that prevent a better understanding of the dynamics of shallow magmatic volatiles in magma reservoirs are (1) the lack of understanding of the dependence of the solubility of complex magmatic fluids (magmatic volatiles) on pressure, temperature and magma composition -thus requiring new experiments- and (2) the lack of understanding of the physics of deforming three-phase magmas (vapors composed of exsolved volatiles, viscous silicate melts and crystals). The work proposed here will not only address the gap in knowledge of magmatic systems described above, it will also push the boundaries of our understanding of the thermodynamics of complex magmatic fluids (with direct application to the chemistry of metallic ore-forming fluids), and multiphase fluid mechanics. This project will generate a massive, systematic volatile solubility data set for 3 melt compositions; these data are required for future expansion of extant thermodynamic models on volatile and fluid behavior in felsic magmas. This project also features a new collaboration which will provide a postdoc and a graduate student with an opportunity to work with and learn from an interdisciplinary research team at different institutions. The PIs have a record of incorporating diverse and under-represented groups within their research and education programs.

Earth history can aide scientists in improving their understanding of the interaction between pCO2 and global climate change, by providing records of past variations in pCO2 and climate recorded in the chemical composition of fossil shells and molecules. In the geologic past, Earth experienced profound changes in pCO2 and climate, but reconstructions remain challenging. This is due to the fact that many of the fossil-producing organisms are now extinct, landscapes have changed, and the chemical composition of the oceans and atmosphere have changed. While researchers actively explore individual archives and model sensitivities, less effort has been spent on developing a broader view of relative strengths and weaknesses of different approaches. This research coordination network will bring the paleoclimate/palcoeanographic research community together with the goal of openly recognizing uncertainties, constructively and jointly working to reduce them, and advancing the understanding of past and future climate change. <br/><br/>To achieve this goal, two workshops will be held, which will bring together established and future specialists in reconstructing and modeling paleo-pCO2 from terrestrial and marine archives. The workshops will focus on validation opportunities for pCO2 proxies and carbon cycle models over the last 65 million years of earth history. Particular attention will be paid to proxy and model cross-calibrations and sensitivity studies in select time periods. A paleo-pCO2 database will be established, and position papers on best practices guidelines will be published. Opportunities will be discussed for carbon cycle and biogeochemical models to improve data syntheses and identify regions for desirable data additions. To improve capacity building within the US, up to four US scientists per year will be provided with an opportunity to enter an analytical and model training program, where they will learn new techniques from experts in the field. To ascertain that all research aspects and demographics are appropriately covered, a 16-member steering committee will both nominate expert workshop participants but also select promising but less well established candidates from an (inter-)national applicant pool."

Nevertheless, the processes responsible for driving the composition of primitive magmas generated in arc regions, which are basaltic, towards the bulk composition that characterizes Earth's continents, which are andesitic, remain intensely debated. A major difficulty in understanding these 'differentiation' processes, and how they may couple with other first-order features of convergent continental margins, is the fact that the deep roots of these magmatically-active regions are rarely exposed in the Earth's surface. However, volcanic eruptions are sometimes capable of transporting deep-sourced rock fragments - known as 'xenoliths' - to the Earth's surface, providing Earth scientists with unique glimpses of processes occurring deep within the continents that are otherwise difficult to study. <br/><br/>In the northern segment of the Andean orogen (southern Colombia), a rare eruption from a recent volcanic vent transported an extraordinary cargo of xenolith fragments sourced from the deep roots of the arc and mantle section beneath it. Therefore, this locality presents a unique opportunity to help unravel the physical and chemical processes that operate during construction of continental crust in magmatically-active regions like the Andes. This award supports two early-career Assistant Professors and a woman who is a PhD student to conduct a detailed geochemical, petrologic and geochronologic study of these unique xenoliths, and the rare eruptions that brought them to the surface. In particular, this research focuses on the 'gravitationally unstable' root of the arc, a section of crustal (i.e., chemically differentiated) rocks with densities greater than the underlying mantle, represented by lithologies such as garnet gabbros, hornblendites, and garnet-bearing pyroxenites. Mechanical removal of density-unstable roots form the base of arcs, a process known as lithospheric foundering (aka, delamination), has not only been identified as a crucial process to explain the chemistry of Earth's continents but is also thought capable of inducing rapid changes in surface elevation, such as those driving the fast Neogene uplift of the Central Andean Plateau. Because the processes taking place in the lower orogenic crust are critical for understanding the uplift history of mountains, the geochemistry of the continents, and the geophysical imaging of the deep lithosphere, results from this investigation will have important implications for our understanding of the geochemical, structural and tectonic history of Andean-type plate margins. In addition to the scientific research products that will result from this investigation, the PIs will collaborate with the Rochester Museum and Science Center (RMSC) on activities that will: 1) explain the origin and physicochemical principles of arc volcanoes to the public of Upstate NY; and 2) continue to organize campus visits for high-school participants of RMSC's 'Next Level Science' summer camps, to provide local students with a direct opportunity to experience college and learn more about upper-level STEM education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The pilot proved the viability of the technique, which makes use of ringed seals who spend the majority of their time in such fjords and who may be appropriately equipped with integrated, location-tracking, CTD, and satellite communication instrumentation. The observations, which will be collected in partnership with colleagues at the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources, will be archived in national data bases, on a project website, and made widely available to others in near real-time. This project will address a currently missing, critical component of the Arctic Observing Network, namely observations of ocean temperatures and salinities along the periphery of the Greenland Ice Sheet. The methodology will lead to a practical, sustainable data stream for hydrographic properties in the notoriously difficult to access regions of the Greenland inner fjords, thus further filling out the overall Arctic Observing Network data portfolio.  Such observations are needed to develop improved physics that can subsequently be directly used in IPCC class, coupled climate models.  The data collection will also be of immense value to researchers studying the behavior of the ringed seals in Greenland. Virtually no behavioral data exists for these seals in the ice-ocean fjords, and the project data can be used to learn about the habitat and distribution of the seals, and ultimately of their possible vulnerability to climate change."

In particular, they could be measured for 1) the natural radioactive isotope, argon-39, which is chemically inert, has a well-known input to the ocean, and half-life of 269 years, and 2) sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), a man-made gas that is chemically inert and has been entering the ocean for the past 6 decades with a well-known, nearly linear increasing input through time. The argon-39 half-life is ideal for investigation of the mean circulation of the deep Atlantic Ocean and SF6 traces the circulation of recently formed deep water.  The current technology to measure SF6 in the ocean and argon-39 on small water samples was not available in the 1980s.  This work will determine if the stored samples collected in the 1980s are uncontaminated by leakage during storage and if the samples can be accurately measured for SF6. If this is the case, it will be possible to compare measurements made on these samples to measurements on samples collected from the same locations on cruises carried out today and in the future. This will provide information on changes in the deep Atlantic circulation that may be occurring as the Earth's climate warms. This project will employ two undergraduate students, providing them laboratory and research experience as they learn how to measure gases with gas chromatography.<br/><br/>The objectives of this EAGER (Early Concept Grant for Exploratory Research) project are to check the integrity of the stored gas samples collected in the 1980s, to determine if these samples are suitable for SF6 measurements, to develop a procedure for transferring aliquots of these samples to other labs, and to assemble all of the information on these samples into a single file that can be distributed to other investigators and posted on oceanographic websites. The samples were collected in two types of containers, 2.8-liter high pressure steel tanks for the Transient Tracers in the Ocean/North Atlantic Study (TTO/NAS) and Tropical Atlantic Study (TTO/TAS) and 4-liter low pressure steel tanks for the South Atlantic Ventilation Experiment (SAVE). The investigators will test the integrity of these samples by comparing the tank pressures to the pressure at the time of collection and by measuring the nitrogen to argon ratio, which will show if there is any atmospheric contamination, on a subset of about 100 samples.  They will determine if the samples are suitable for SF6 measurements by measuring SF6 on this subset using the method used routinely to perform these measurements at sea, and comparing these measurements to CFC-11 and CFC-12 measured at sea on these cruises. The sample subset will include vertical profiles from surface to bottom at about 8 stations and surface samples from about 20 stations.  SF6 concentrations in the surface samples will be compared to the expected concentrations assuming equilibrium with the atmospheric concentration at the time of sample collection. If successful, these measurements will ensure the integrity of samples collected in the 1980s and open the door for using these samples to investigate deep water circulation in the Atlantic Ocean during the 1980s and changes in this circulation since the 1980s.  There may also be interest in making other tracer and chemical measurements that were not possible in the 1980s.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research team will explore how recovery may depend upon often difficult-to-see processes such as the interplay of migration and natural selection in marine species. While the population of sea stars is currently rebounding due to several years of unusually high recruitment, the sea star wasting disease continues to persist at low levels. This project aims to determine the genetic consequences of the pandemic and subsequent recovery. The team will determine whether the majority of susceptible sea stars have died and identify possible refuges where susceptible sea stars survived. They will examine the potential for heritable variation in resistance to this disease in order to assess whether the new recruits are tolerant or susceptible to wasting. Resolving these issues will enable predictions about the trajectory of their recovery and the potential responses to future large scale disease outbreaks. Research findings will be shared with resource managers and scientists at a collaborative workshop that will focus on state-of-the-art methods to advance research on marine diseases. The public will have the opportunity to learn more about sea star wasting disease through a partnership with the UCSC Seymour Marine Discovery Center and can track the incidence of disease using an online interactive map available at www.seastarwasting.org. Results will be incorporated into professional development for teachers with CalTeach and adapted for teaching materials up to college-level. This project will train diverse early career scientists - undergraduates, graduates, and a postdoctoral scholar - in integration of ecological and genomic methods.<br/><br/>Understanding the consequences of large-scale pandemics in the broader contexts of geographic heterogeneity and chronic changes in ocean pH and temperature is an emerging contemporary issue. This project employs long-term characterization of population dynamics and genetic consequences of a sea star wasting disease (SSWD) outbreak, which caused median 90% mortality in Pisaster ochraceus populations in the northeastern Pacific, to estimate potential long-term consequences for the species. While the largest recorded influx of new recruits occurred in 2014-2016, it is unknown where they originated from, whether recruits and surviving adults remained susceptible to the disease, which persisted at low levels, and for how long these dynamics might continue. This long-term dataset provides a unique opportunity for exploring the short and long term repercussions of such large-scale disease outbreaks and the population dynamics that they precipitate. This project builds on long-term field studies of wild populations to describe host population dynamics, the disease, and genomic diversity. The goal is to discover genetic variation associated with SSWD and to dissociate that variation from population genomic effects attributable to abiotic environmental variation. Objectives are: (1) Census P. ochraceus at 24 sites throughout its range to describe population dynamics, the prevalence of SSWD, and measure abiotic variables. (2) Conduct laboratory experiments coupled with RNAseq analyses to determine loci differentially regulated during exposure to SSWD, temperature, salinity, and pCO2 anomalies. (3) Map ddRAD, RNAseq, and candidate loci under selection to a P. ochraceus genome. (4) Conduct range-wide population genomic analyses for 3 years to assess genetic (SNP) variation among wild-caught specimens with, versus without, SSWD across a geographic mosaic of abiotic variation. (5) Explore links between SSWD and candidate loci, such as EF1A.  These analyses will describe the immediate genomic consequences of the disease outbreak, the population dynamics that the outbreak set in motion, and the interplay of factors and mechanisms - such as disease, temperature, migration, selection - that affected these changes. The results will advance understanding of general processes and interactions that shape population genomic structure in coastal ecosystems, providing resources to inform future research and applications in design of management strategies for coastal living resources."

CANVASS (Coastal Alliance Network for Visualization, Assessment, Science, and Stakeholders) is a network led by Stony Brook University's (SBU?s) School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, in collaboration with Co-PIs at Howard University, Northeastern University, SBU?s Department of Computer Science and Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science, and interdisciplinary partners from across the Northeast and mid-Atlantic coastal United States. The goals of CANVASS are twofold: (1) to spread innovative approaches from these fields within an integrated network of scientists, policy-makers, educators, and stakeholders; and (2) to grow the network into a hub that connects high-impact research, community participation, and educational approaches. <br/><br/>This approach integrates state-of-the-art visualization and interactive techniques to support the understanding of data and risk, along with the use of an ""ethical matrix"" for stakeholders to systematically represent, discuss, understand, and weigh tradeoffs and perspectives. SBU?s data visualization center, the Reality Deck, the world?s largest immersive display, will be used along with other visualization approaches to connect partners and stakeholders to large, multidimensional datasets and models that will help them view, manipulate, analyze, understand, and communicate about data. The project will focus initially on coastal-urban flood risk from sea level rise, storm surge, and heavy rainfall. Workshops will explore how visualizations can scaffold both scientific advances and effective stakeholder interactions. Approaches and methods that are developed through this work will be exportable to other coastal urban areas, and can thus be used to mitigate other sorts of climate risk beyond flooding, as well as human-environmental problems more broadly. CANVASS will recruit students, including those underrepresented in the climate sciences, to learn first-hand how predictive science can translate into actionable decision-making.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
