These data contain information about earthquakes, volcano eruptions, subsurface changes, changes in weather pattern, to name the few, and are vital for understanding various phenomena that affect the Earth and how they evolve over time.  This project aims to make a significant step forward in converting these analog data into usable digital format by introducing artificial intelligence to the conversion process.  Currently, there is a software that takes a record image and generates digital seismograms, but it requires substantial  human interaction making this process slow, impractical, or impossible.  Successful implementation of artificial intelligence will allow more data to be processed quickly for use by the scientific community, which is a significant broader impact. <br/><br/>The project will start by examining the digitized analyses to determine and build the training database to be used for the construction of the neural network. The investigators will also identify steps that will benefit most from implementation of artificial intelligence procedures to decrease human interaction and improve accuracy of the digitization of seismograms.   Neural networks for image classification and object identification are now available and will be examined to find the algorithm that is most suitable for the seismogram digitization process.  The improved digitization software will be openly available to increase users and provide a robust tool to convert analog seismogram images to research-quality digital seismograms.  It will enable the seismological community to retrieve data that for application of modern analyses, and open opportunities for new types of research to be done.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the same time, the Arctic as a whole is experiencing unprecedented changes and setting new records, including the decline of Arctic sea ice cover, the decline and early snowmelt onset of Northern Hemisphere snow cover, and an overall warming at a rate more than double anywhere else on the planet.  Studying and understanding the mechanisms linking the different Arctic components (Greenland, snow cover, and sea ice in the case of this research) and how, in turn, their changes are related to and driven by the atmosphere is fundamental to capture the physical processes driving the changes. This is, indeed, one of the key aspects to considerably improve our skills in estimating the future evolution of the Arctic under different warming scenarios and in projecting future sea level rise.<br/><br/>This research is quantifying the relationships between sea ice, snow cover, atmospheric circulation changes and mass changes over the Greenland ice sheet through a combination of observational and modeling tools. These include in situ observations of sea ice cover and snow extent as well as remote sensing products and estimates of atmospheric circulation changes and outputs from climate models. We also use artificial intelligence (e.g., neural networks) to examine relationships between climate, atmospheric patterns and Greenland changes. Ultimately, this research is testing the hypothesis that atmospheric circulation changes associated with sea ice and snow cover extent variability control the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet by modulating snowfall and surface melting. This research is also providing new insights on the linkages between the Arctic and mid-latitudes and how sea ice and snow cover changes might affect weather patterns outside the Arctic, including the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This network will include 35 sites in Alaska and Canada, bringing additional measurements to a data-sparse region.  The development activities also include making the system dynamic, adaptable, and autonomous.  Improving the amount and quality of data will help to answer many questions about the basic ionospheric processes, which could lead to improvements in the robustness of satellite navigation systems.  Many of the receivers will also be placed at schools, providing an educational benefit to the students.<br/><br/>The goal of this development award is to provide a ground-based sensor web network that provides both real-time and historical Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) ionospheric data products for use in geospace science and space weather monitoring in currently unsampled or under-sampled auroral/polar regions in North America.  A sensor web is a dynamic, adaptable, and autonomous network of sensors that can use artificial intelligence to react in real time to information from its instruments.  Thirty-five GNSS receivers will be deployed in Alaska and Canada to retrieve Total Electron Content (TEC) and scintillation statistics.  The project will result in the creation of a unified North American TEC map, development and deployment of triggering algorithms for highly dynamic periods, and the distribution of real-time TEC data to users.  Four specific scientific topics would be addressed: 1) What mechanism is responsible for the formation of polar cap patches?  And how do polar cap patches exit the night-side polar cap?  What is the relationship of the tongue of ionization to polar cap patches? 2) What contribution does the lower atmosphere make to variability in the high-latitude ionosphere? 3) What causes the irregularities that form at the front of the tongue of ionization in the nightside polar ionosphere?  What causes the irregularities that form with the SED plume as observed by SuperDarn? 4) What are the specific auroral and sub-auroral mechanisms that produce GPS scintillations?"

Such grids suffice to capture the dynamics of cyclones, fronts, and other large-scale atmospheric phenomena, but these phenomena depend critically on processes with spatial scales much smaller than the grid spacing.  The small-scale processes must be represented indirectly, through parameterization schemes which estimate their net impact on the resolved atmospheric state.  For example clouds are typically too small for the grid spacing yet they are critical for moving moisture from the ocean surface to the mid-troposphere, thus cloud parameterizations play a key role in determining atmospheric humidity even on the largest spatial scales.  Parameterization schemes are inherently approximate, and the development of schemes which produce realistic simulations is a central challenge of model development.  Shortcomings in parameterization limit the usefulness of weather and climate models both for scientific research and for societal applications.<br/><br/>Most parameterization schemes depend critically on various parameters whose values cannot be determined a priori but must instead be found through trial and error.  This task, referred to as ""tuning"", is laborious as it is performed separately for each parameterization scheme and involves multiple integrations of the model in multiple configurations. It is also inefficient in its use of observations, which is unfortunate given the large amount of observational data available from satellites and other sources. The resulting parameter sets may not be optimal and may produce unexpected results when all the schemes interact with each other in global simulations.  Finally, manual tuning is not conducive to uncertainty quantification, which would be valuable for estimating the uncertainty in future climate change projections. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to replace ad hoc manual tuning with a combination of data assimilation, machine learning, and fine-scale process modeling using large eddy simulation (LES) models.  LES models have grid spacings of a few tens of meters and can explicitly simulate the clouds and turbulence represented by parameterization schemes.  These ingredients are combined to create a global Machine Learning Atmospheric Model (MLAM), in which LES models embedded in selected grid columns of a global model explicitly simulate subgrid-scale processes which are represented by parameterization schemes in the other columns. Machine learning is used to tune the schemes to emulate the behavior of the LES simulations, so that explicit simulations become an online benchmark for parameterization.  In this way all the schemes can be tuned together and interactively within a running global simulation.  Observational data from a variety of sources is assimilated during the model integration to provide a further constraint on parameter values, and estimates of parameter uncertainty are generated as part of the automated tuning.  A similar tuning process is implemented in an ocean general circulation model, and the two are combined to produce a machine learning climate model.  Model tuning is generally viewed as a necessary but mundane activity which is not in itself a research topic.  But a model capable of learning its parameters from observations and process models offers a new path forward, toward both better models and better ways of using models.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts due to the societal value of better forecasts and projections from weather and climate models.  The work directly addresses uncertainty in forecasts and projections used by decision makers to plan for weather and climate impacts.  In addition, the modeling strategy developed here is applicable to a broad class of research areas which face the problem of relating large-scale behaviors to small-scale unresolved processes (the problem of relating genotypes to phenotypes in evolutionary biology, for example).  In addition, the PIs will establish a cross-disciplinary graduate program on data-driven Earth system modeling. The program bridges the gap between environmental and computational sciences which currently hinders progress in environmental modeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the largest moisture reservoir and ultimate moisture source, water from the oceans sustains terrestrial precipitation and is thus key to understanding variability in the water cycle on land. Floods and droughts represent extremes of the water cycle that have enormous consequences for society. In recent years Western drought has led to billions of dollars of agricultural losses and extensive wildfires, while floods produced similar losses in the South, Midwest and East of the US. They are caused by an excess or deficit of moisture exported from ocean to land.  Moisture evaporating from the ocean surface is the ultimate source for terrestrial precipitation. Thus, the availability of the oceanic moisture supply modulates the severity of hydroclimate extremes on land. As moisture exits the ocean, it leaves a signature in sea surface salinity. Recent studies have provided remarkable new evidence that salinity can be utilized as a skillful predictor of precipitation in the US Midwest, Southwest and other regions. The salinity precursors significantly outperform temperature-based predictors, especially in the years with heavy precipitation or exceptional drought.  Thus, sea surface salinity has great potential to provide a transformative improvement to seasonal forecasts of US hydroclimate extremes. This project will develop the scientific basis for a drought and flood early warning system for the US based on these new insights into the predictive potential of ocean salinity and the expanding salinity monitoring system that uses both in-situ measurements and satellites. This will lead to a number of societal benefits: lives saved and property preserved from wildfires and floods; improved crop yields resulting from more accurate seasonal rainfall forecasts; national security advances realized by better anticipation of destabilized regions affected by drought or flood crises; and more accurate forecasting of energy demand and the impact of water shortages on power plants. Several undergraduate students will have the opportunity to gain valuable research experience, and thus the project will help to train the next generation of climate scientists. Project findings will also be incorporated into graduate courses taught through the MIT/WHOI joint program and at Duke University, and the knowledge will be disseminated to the general public. <br/><br/>The processes that produce the newly identified relationships between extreme precipitation and sea surface salinity will be explored. Daily precipitation data and a Bayesian statistical framework will be used to sample the extreme events in the US. Based on the Bayesian inference, the pre-season salinity precursors will be explored and mechanisms by which the water cycle generates the salinity signatures determined by calculating atmospheric moisture fluxes and the terms in the surface salinity budget. In addition, the oceanic moisture flux onto land will be tracked, and the processes assessed by which extremes develop through the moisture supply and/or energy redistribution in the atmospheric column. Machine-learning algorithms to predict extremes using the sea surface salinity precursors will be developed and applied. Novel approaches will be used in this project, including the use of Bayesian statistics to identify the optimal sea surface salinity and temperature predictors for rainfall extremes, analysis of the oceanic salinity budget to identify the driving atmospheric variables, analysis of the atmospheric circulations that transport water from ocean to land, and the development of machine learning algorithms to provide optimal seasonal predictions of extreme drought or floods."

This understanding has vital importance for understanding how oxygen controls the crystallization path and composition of cooling magmas, also providing insight into processes that may have operated on and in the magma as it moved to the surface. Graduate and undergraduate students at Mount Holyoke College, the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, and the University of Idaho will be supported by this project, including at least three women.<br/> <br/>The ability to measure redox states at sub-nm and pm scales is a formidable analytical challenges due to the inherent anisotropy of most rock-forming minerals, which causes their crystal structures to interact with photons differently according to crystal orientation.

The team will use these data to build a universal calibration appropriate for quantifying the partial pressure of oxygen (oxygen fugacity) in pyroxene-bearing samples. This work has the potential to advance knowledge in multiple geological disciplines. It will also enable synchrotrons around the world that use the Athena software package to quickly and easily determine Fe3+ contents of pyroxene minerals with known precision and accuracy.

Simulations of earth's climate thus require an approximate representation of these flows which is fast enough to be practical and accurate enough to capture phenomena of interest, such as the warming effect of carbon dioxide (CO2).  The development of such representations, referred to as radiative transfer parameterizations or more simply as radiation schemes, is challenging given that the transparency of the atmosphere to infrared radiation can vary abruptly from one wavelength to another. Practical radiation schemes exist, but they are challenging to develop and update and it is not generally feasible to tailor them to specific applications. For example the version of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) available in 2020 uses a radiation scheme published in 2008, despite the availability of new spectroscopic observations, and the same version is used for full-complexity present-day simulations and for idealized simulations that would benefit from a faster but less accurate version.<br/><br/>This award supports the creation of a toolkit that would greatly enhance the ability of climate researchers to create radiative transfer parameterizations suitable for their needs.  The user would supply a set of benchmark atmospheres, specified as profiles of temperature and composition (water vapor and CO2, for instance), that cover the range of conditions anticipated in the particular application, and the toolbox would use a sophisticated line-by-line radiative transfer model and a database of up-to-date spectroscopic observations to create parameterization options with varying degrees of accuracy and computational cost.  Users would then be able to choose the best trade-off between cost and accuracy for their application.  In addition, the project creates parameterizations for specific research goals: one for simulations of paleoclimates with high CO2 concentrations and two for studies of the interaction between radiation and convective clouds (one emphasizing speed, which can be invoked more frequently, and one emphasizing accuracy).  A third, developed with collaborators at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (funded through other sources), is optimized for simulations of present-day climate and prediction of climate fluctuations including El Nino events.<br/><br/>The project also includes work on alternative methods for parameterizing radiative transfer, one of which is a discrete frequency approximation, in which an optimally chosen set of strictly monochromatic spectral lines is used instead of a representation in terms of frequency bands.  The lines are determined from the spectral database using a fast optimization technique such as simulated annealing.  The second is a machine learning approach designed to emulate the underlying exact solutions to the radiative transfer equations.<br/><br/>The work has broader impacts through the development of a key piece of infrastructure for weather and climate models.  The work will thus have benefit for the worldwide community that relies on these models as tools for basic science research.  Workshops and tutorials are supported to facilitate community engagement.  The work also enhances the value of model-based predictions and projections as guidance for decision makers concerned with climate variability and change. The project supports a postdoc and a graduate student, thus providing for the future workforce in climate model development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This information includes equipment capabilities, original and edited experimental data, laboratory calibrations, as well as information about testing protocols and procedures. Recent developments in data mining techniques and machine learning have made it possible to utilize and digest large amounts of information; yet such data must be initially prepared and structured in a meaningful way. This project will initially develop a prototype database resource with sample data, which will be available for testing by researchers and the public. The final resource will be compatible with Strabospot, a newly developed digital data system, which will enable the comparison of field and experimental data based on key criteria. The LAPS resource will help improve the quality of scientific and technical studies, such that: 1. Laboratory managers will be able to compare data using standardized testing protocols in order to improve data quality; 2. Data analysts will be able to quickly examine large sets of experimental data using new algorithms and potentially discover previously unnoticed phenomena and correlations; and 3.  teachers will be able to search and access experimental data in real-time to illustrate concepts discussed in the classroom. <br/><br/>Laboratory data are essential for testing and refining theories and models in the Earth sciences. Yet, this data is currently not accessible in digital, searchable form, limiting its utility. Recently a digital data system, StraboSpot, was developed to incorporate field and microstructural data and make it available to the public. The utility of StraboSpot will be further enhanced by the integration of data from laboratory experiments on rock mechanics and properties. However, there are a wide variety of specialized laboratories, and many follow their own procedures and standards. The goal of this project is to integrate relevant data and metadata from rock mechanics experiments conducted at any laboratory into the StraboSpot system so that the data is openly accessible and searchable by any interested party. This project will establish a coherent and effective way to describe equipment and experiments across a variety of testing rigs and devices to facilitate communication and common standards in experimental geophysics. Goals of the project include publishing data for the broad Earth science community and improving interlaboratory communication. Specific research objectives include: 1. Collecting data for lab specific procedures, needs, and current workflows; 2. Outlining and describing metadata structure, attributes, formats, and restrictions for experimental data via community input; 3. Building an inventory of experimental systems and their capabilities for the benefit of the experimental community; 4. Publishing applications and tools to aid integration with StraboSpot; 5.

Tropical-subtropical teleconnections occur either via the atmosphere, which can set up within a season, or through subsurface ocean pathways operating over years to decades. The formation in the subtropics and subsequent advection of anomalous heat due to water mass anomalies is a potentially important ocean pathway. Some theoretical studies suggest this process controls multiyear to decadal climate variability. Anomalies are created in two ways: at the surface by wind, heat and freshwater flux changes or in the subsurface by anomalous advection. Using the recent record from the Argo array of profiling floats, many regional studies have identified the formation and propagation of water mass anomalies in most ocean basins. Modern ocean general circulation model studies with realistic surface forcing can form and advect anomalies similar to the observed ones. However, the two descriptions do not agree on whether these anomalies can survive to reach the equator, and then re-emerge to the surface. This project will take a globally consistent observational and modelling approach to quantitatively understand the source, fate and potential re-emergence of subtropical water mass anomalies, and thus their potential to influence the climate. As part of this project, an improved gridded global Argo analysis will be made freely available with particular focus on water mass variability and realistic estimates of resolved scales and errors.  A production system will be put in place to ensure ongoing updates and distribution of the analysis. A graduate student in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program will learn both numerical modelling (including the analysis of ensembles) and observational analysis techniques. Since the targeted processes are a prime candidate for enabling longer term climate forecasting, results will discussed directly with climate forecasting teams in the US and Australia via collaborator Peter Oke.<br/><br/>This project will combine a novel analysis of Argo data with a set of tailored ensembles of OGCM runs to identify source regions of observed water mass variability.   A model-based ensemble optimal interpolation (OI) will be used for the first time to map Argo data, both on depth and density surfaces.  Global observed surface conditions will be used to force a numerical model specifically configured and tuned to simulate the water mass variability in the Argo period. This all-forcing ensemble will then be compared to parallel ensembles with restricted tropical and subtropical/hemispheric forcing where the temperature, salinity and wind components will be varied to examine the generation and fate of anomalies generated in different regions.  The goal is to attribute observed equatorial variability in each ocean basin to local and/or remote drivers and assess if there is any evidence for re-emergence. Examining all basins, which vary in source strength, advective pathways, mixing rates and throughflows, will result in a more unified view of where and when subtropical variability impacts the far field. The observational approach will involve carefully checking and removing sensor errors and using a dynamically-intelligent model-based ensemble OI framework. Rather than diagnosing formation mechanisms through incomplete observations or from a single all-forcing model run, the study will use dedicated ensembles of simulations with controlled regional surface forcing.  An ensemble approach will clearly quantify the role that intrinsic variability (due to instabilities) plays in the model system and in turn, will help better understand the observed record.   By focusing on the feeder flows to the equatorial upwelling systems, the team will then assess the importance of the proposed ocean tunnel to climate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In these plasmas, collisions between charged particles are rare. As a result, plasma waves are a major means of transferring energy from one charged particle population to another. Charged particles ""surf"" the waves. To first order, those that are moving slightly faster than the waves are energized, while those moving slower lose energy to the waves causing them to grow. There are a wide variety of plasma waves with different properties and different source mechanisms. Three of these (plasmaspheric hiss, chorus, and electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves) are widely believed to play significant roles in the depletion of the electron radiation belts but how this happens and how each contributes with local time and radial distance are still-open and strongly debated questions of fundamental importance. During their interactions with the waves, electrons are scattered out of their trapped orbits and sent on trajectories into the dense atmosphere where they are lost through collisions. The work will independently examine experimental observations and, most importantly, use theoretical tools to understand the interactions leading to the precipitation. The science questions to be addressed in this proposal are particularly important, since electron precipitation leads to chemical changes in the upper atmosphere, and is critical in regulating ring current and radiation belt electron dynamics. The grant will support the further training and development of a promising female early-career scientist. The results will be useful to the broader space physics and upper atmosphere communities, to researchers studying the chemistry of the middle atmosphere, and for space environment applications, such as active mitigation techniques for both natural and artificial radiation in space.<br/><br/>Testing theoretical ideas about particular wave-particle interactions and the variations in the space environment that effect them has been difficult because the waves are measured at large radial distances in the magnetosphere while the electron precipitation that they produce must be viewed from low-earth orbit. To complicate matters, the mix of plasma waves depends on the radial distance and magnetic local time but in addition is an as yet to be determined function of the severity of space weather storming, and the phase of the storm. The principal investigator (PI) has developed an innovative technique to analyze the physical relationship between wave intensity and wave-driven electron pitch angle scattering loss, which can be directly implemented using conjugate observations from near-equatorial and low-altitude satellites. This project, which uses both theory and observation, will provide a definitive understanding of the quantitative contribution of each type of plasma wave to electron precipitation within various energy ranges and in different L-MLT regions. The results will provide a highly important contribution to our wider understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the hazardous radiation environment surrounding the Earth."

For example, prey often spend less time feeding and more time watching out for predators, which comes with the cost of lower food intake and thus slower growth. Such ""non-consumptive effects"" (NCEs) have been described for a wide range of terrestrial and marine prey species, from elk to clams, but mostly in short-term (< 1 month) experiments. These prior results suggest that in some cases, the behavioral changes (NCEs) have a bigger effect on prey populations than consumption by predators (CEs). However, those short-term, controlled experiments may artificially inflate the perceived importance of NCEs. Over longer time periods, prey may adapt or become acclimated to predation risk, and NCEs may become less important. Additionally, environmental variability (e.g., differences in the availability of the prey's food between study sites) may have a bigger effect on prey populations than NCEs do. This project will use a combination of short- (months) and long-term (years) field experiments and mathematical models to evaluate the role of NCEs on Florida oyster reefs. The prey species in this study is the eastern oyster, an important marine resource in the southeast US for harvesting and habitat creation; the main oyster predator is a mud crab. In this study, results from mathematical models of oyster populations will be compared to experimental data from the field to see whether including NCEs in the model leads to better model predictions. Better understanding of NCEs in oysters should improve management of that important marine resource. Furthermore, the mathematical model will be used to develop broader, generalizable conclusions about the importance of NCEs that could be applied to other important prey species. This project will provide data useful for oyster resource management, will support public education regarding the ecological importance of NCEs, and will enhance the scientific engagement of underrepresented groups in the study region. The project will support a partnership with the Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve in Florida, including data sharing, sponsoring an oyster management symposium, and funding the development of multimedia scientific outreach materials at the reserve that will be used by a large and diverse population of K-12 students in the surrounding community. The project will train a postdoctoral researcher, two graduate students, two undergraduate students, and research results will be disseminated by those students and the principal investigators at scientific conferences, in journal publications, and in online content through an ongoing partnership with a Florida public television station. <br/><br/>Predators can alter prey population dynamics by causing fear-based shifts in prey traits (nonconsumptive effect, NCE). The importance of NCEs for prey populations - relative to direct consumption by predators (consumptive effects, CEs) - remains uncertain, particularly because short-term studies of NCEs cannot estimate their effect over multiple prey generations. This project addresses that knowledge gap by combining short- and long-term field experiments with population models to investigate the importance of NCEs on oyster population dynamics in a Florida estuary. The central question is whether accounting for NCEs improves the ability to predict long-term trends in oyster population abundance. Several types of NCEs are present in this system: exposure to water containing predator odors reduces oyster larval recruitment and causes juvenile oysters to increase shell thickness, reducing their somatic growth. In addition to CEs and NCEs , environmental gradients in stress, food, and propagule delivery are also present in this system. Those environmental factors can have strong effects on post-settlement survivorship, growth, and recruitment of oysters, so the relative importance of predator CEs and NCEs may vary along those spatial gradients as well. This project will consist of four components. (1) A series of short-term field experiments to test how NCEs vary with predator density and environmental variables, and whether one of the NCEs (increased shell thickness) actually reduces vulnerability to predators. (2) A population model, parameterized using experimental results; model simulations will quantify how the relative importance of NCEs should vary over time, space, and environmental gradients. (3) A longer-term (3.5 year) field experiment; the results from this experiment will be compared to model predictions to test whether accounting for NCEs improves predictions of long-term variation in oyster population dynamics. (4) A general form of the model will be developed to broadly investigate the effect of NCEs on non-equilibrium, transient population dynamics. By combining models and field experiments, this project will bridge the gap between the theoretical understanding of how NCEs affect population dynamics and empirical tests of that theory, advancing the field towards the goal of predicting how multiple interacting factors structure communities."

The oceans act as the flywheel of the climate system, playing major roles in the climate, the water cycle, the carbon cycle, global energy budgets, and sea level rise. Study and understanding of this component of the Earth System requires integrated multi-disciplinary investigations with access to oceanographic data of biological, chemical, geological, and physical origin. The Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (BCO-DMO) was created to serve PIs funded by the NSF Biological and Chemical Oceanography Sections and the Division of Polar Programs Antarctic Organisms and Ecosystems Program as a facility where marine biogeochemical and ecological data and information developed in the course of scientific research can be managed and made publicly available. BCO-DMO provides integrated chemical, biological and physical data inventories from a number of large and intermediate-sized programs, as well as single investigator projects. BCO-DMO also provides scientific investigators the opportunity to explore complex and multifaceted datasets and supports cross-disciplinary collaboration to address pressing environmental questions, problems, and challenges that are exacerbated with the increasing pace of climate change. The BCO-DMO collection of datasets contributed by researchers funded by NSF and others is a publicly available resource accessible via the BCO-DMO website. BCO-DMO supports synthesis and modeling activities, reuse of oceanographic data for new research endeavors, availability of ""real data"" for classroom use by teachers and students at K-12 and college level, and provides decision-support field data for policy-relevant issues. BCO-DMO outreach activities include participation in community training courses and workshops both national and international, and help to foster long-term collaborative partnerships between data management professionals and research investigators. These outreach activities reduce community barriers by fostering the sharing of ideas among synergistic, but otherwise independent research groups. BCO-DMO actively participates in the exchange of knowledge at oceanographic and informatics meetings, an important mechanism by which standards development and adoption occurs. <br/><br/>The primary goal of the BCO-DMO data management repository is to manage existing and new datasets from NSF funded individual scientific investigators and collaborative groups of investigators, and to make the data available online. The BCO-DMO data management system is composed of a metadata database and the distributed client-server JGOFS/GLOBEC data system, plus text-based and map-based user interfaces and support for machine clients to access the information and data available from the repository. The office works with principal investigators and other data contributors to support all phases of the data lifecycle; maintain an inventory of projects, deployments, and datasets; generate standards-compliant metadata records as required by federal agencies; promote compliance with the NSF Ocean Sciences data policy; ensure submission of data to national data centers for archive; support and encourage data synthesis by providing enhanced data discovery and access systems; facilitate interoperability among distributed data repositories; and facilitate regional, national, and international data and information exchange. The office participates in the development and use of open-source, standards-based technologies that enable interoperable data systems to exchange data and information that will foster next-generation research in all disciplines. As the analysis of ocean processes becomes more and more sophisticated, multidisciplinary data integration will also grow more complex. BCO-DMO fosters information sharing and is committed to being a fundamental component of the ocean science research infrastructure without which the goals of existing and future ocean research programs cannot be met."

We will develop and leverage immersive learning tools that bring state-of-the-art sustainability science directly to >3,000 students, with the potential to scale to reach hundreds of thousands of students. Our educational approach combines interactive computer models with engaging role-play simulations, in which students learn for themselves by making decisions, and then finding out, through the computer models, how the Earth and energy systems are expected to respond to those decisions. In short, rather than being lectured to, students learn for themselves through a process that mimics scientific discovery. Further, our learning tools will take students ?under the hood,? to understand important Earth system processes and to gain a deeper understanding of the modeling process. Our project focuses on a student target audience that is currently under-represented in STEM: economically disadvantaged, first-generation-in-college students in federally funded TRIO Student Support Services programs. This focus will benefit the project by (1) leveraging and improving existing programs and networks for dissemination; (2) enhancing participation in the scientific enterprise by college students; and (3) enhancing the prospects of economically disadvantaged students.<br/><br/>Part 2<br/>Overview:<br/>The overarching goal of this proposal is to broaden the pathway of low-income, first-generation-in-college students to the geosciences through development, implementation, and evaluation of scalable simulation-based climate and sustainability science educational tools. Our project team brings together expertise in climate and sustainability education (UMass Lowell Climate Change Initiative, or CCI, and Dr. McNeal), educational evaluation and research (SageFox Consulting Group and Dr. Newton), and leaders in advancing college access and success opportunities for low-income, first-generation-in-college students through federally funded TRIO Student Support Services (SSS) programs around the Nation (the Council for Opportunity in Education, or COE). Our goal is to significantly increase geoscience knowledge, interest, and motivation among early, low-income, first-generation undergraduate students. The three key project  components include: (1) Develop and test a new ?Geo-Interactive? curriculum that is centered on engaging simulation-based learning tools, uses an active learning approach to introduce climate and Earth system feedback processes, and makes direct connections to academic career opportunities; (2) Leverage the extensive nationwide network of 1,080 TRIO SSS programs that together reach >205,000 students to implement, propagate, and disseminate the Geo-Interactive curriculum to those currently underrepresented in STEM professions, careers or education pathways; and (3) Determine the impact of the Geo-Interactive curriculum on geoscience-related motivation, learning, and career interest.<br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>The simulation-based curriculum we are proposing takes an approach that is supported by educational research: it is student-centered, experiential, and addresses a highly relevant, real-world problem. The proposed curriculum will include the World Climate simulation, which was co-developed by the PI and our project partners at Climate Interactive. Initial results have shown that World Climate delivers significant gains in climate literacy, systems thinking skills, and, importantly student motivation to learn and do more about climate and sustainability. By combining World Climate with new modules that explore geoscience concepts and academic and career opportunities, potential paths into geoscience will be opened for students whose engagement and motivation has been stimulated. Importantly, our target population are early undergraduates in SSS programs, a demographic that is under-represented in the geosciences and STEM more generally, and that has strong potential to broaden and diversify the Nation?s geoscience pipeline.<br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The proposed project is designed to benefit to society by: (1) contributing to the evidence base for effective educational approaches that reach all students, with a focus on students who have been underserved and underrepresented in the geoscience and STEM pipelines; (2) playing a role in closing the projected shortfall in geoscience professionals by broadening geoscience participation among more than 3,000 low-income, first-generation undergraduate students; (3) building a citizenry and workforce that is informed about and enable to make effective decisions in the context of global environmental change."

Engaging students in viewing science through a societal and multicultural lens is a critical part of workforce development and more specifically, important in creating student leaders in global environmental science. This workshop will help address needed approaches for communication upskilling and generate opportunities for students to work in multicultural and multi-institutional teams with an eye towards broadening their views on the application of environmental science to local communities and cultures. Presenting research in an international context also provides students with cross-cultural experiences as they move into professional careers.<br/><br/>Part 2<br/>Communicating science to decision makers is a critical part of preparing graduate students and early career researchers. This proposal outlines a unique learning experience for students, and particularly students interested in multicultural perspectives on global environmental issues with a background in environmental science and are interested in the intersection of environmental science and decision-making. While there is strong interest in experiential and multidisciplinary learning, it is more difficult to institute in practice for environmental research in international negotiations due to lack of suitable opportunities, especially for students from smaller institutions or without the economic means to travel to international settings. The proposed workshop focuses on: (1) building a sense of community for diverse students and others in advance of international professional experiences; (2) providing a platform for students to actively participate through their presentations to a global audience on environmental issues; (3) generating student-led posters and presentations at professional societies such as American Geological Union (AGU) and Ecological Society of America (ESA) as part of the student professional development; and (4) providing a social cohort and shared experience for diversity and first-generation students to experience international professional meetings. Importantly, workshop will address a common issue among institutions that students attending international science meetings are ill-prepared to grasp the complexity of fast-paced negotiations.

With little time to prepare, water resource and hydrology professors and lecturers must generate online content rapidly for at least the spring and summer semesters of 2020, with an increasing possibility this format will extend into the fall 2020 term. At the same time, there is large variation in access to and preparation for online delivery among institutions and individual faculty. In the hydrologic sciences, we expect preparation for the transition to online instruction and the resultant learning to vary based on program size, institution, instructor experience, and availability of instructional support. Taken together, there is a significant risk that hydrologic instruction will divide into ?haves? and ?have nots? as a result of these critical differences. Equal access to critical support and instructional resources during the transition from traditional to distance learning in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is critical to closing this gap and providing equal access to high quality instruction in the hydrologic sciences. Thus, our goal is to enable access to educational infrastructure and training for instructors, and ultimately students, in the hydrologic sciences in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. <br/><br/>This project will implement six key activities to achieve our goal including: (1) facilitating two-way communication between instructors and students through panel discussions and survey templates; (2) enabling sharing of course materials through CUAHSI?s HydroShare platform; (3) developing open-source, data-driven educational resources; (4) developing a guest lecture database for hydrologic sciences; (5) community training and support using distance education materials and platforms; and (6) hosting a series of workshops and producing a synthesis report on distance education in the hydrologic sciences. The result of these activities will be a leveled playing field for accessible, quality education to all instructors and students in hydrologic science. Moreover, we expect these efforts to foster a community of online educators in hydrologic science who will develop and use educational resources that will persist well beyond the present COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the expanded use of distance education resources supports ongoing initiatives to expand Diversity, Equality, and Inclusion in the hydrologic sciences by CUAHSI and the HydroLearn platform to share undergraduate educational materials.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Hydrologic Sciences and Education and Human Resources programs in the Division of Earth Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to these properties, constellations of 10s-100s of CubeSats with specialized instruments for studying the space environment provide a new exciting opportunity to understand and predict space weather.  The Space Weather Atmospheric Reconfigurable Multiscale Experiment (SWARM-EX) project provides an important step in the advancement of designing and building CubeSat constellations for space weather.  SWARM-EX will consist of three identical CubeSats with novel technologies for radio communications between satellites, onboard propulsion, advanced data downlinks, and autonomous operations within the constellation.  Each satellite will measure ionized and neutral gases in the Earth's upper atmosphere, studying structures seen near the equator.  The SWARM-EX mission uniquely fosters opportunities for STEM education and enables a platform for public outreach.  SWARM-EX will establish the first Intercollegiate CubeSat Mentoring Program - partnering institutions that have established CubeSat programs with new programs to create long-term, project-based learning environments across the nation.  Teaching, training, and learning will also be advanced through the inclusion of multiple graduate students, and undergraduate students from the six geographically distributed university programs involved in SWARM-EX.  This project resulted from the Ideas Lab: Cross-cutting Initiative in CubeSat Innovations, an interdisciplinary program supported by Geosciences, Engineering, and Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorates.<br/><br/>SWARM-EX is a bold step towards addressing outstanding aeronomy questions achieved through a global constellation of CubeSat swarms making in-situ ionospheric and thermospheric measurements between 300 and 600 km altitude.  The CubeSats in each swarm will range in separation from 1 to 1000 km and this separation will be controlled by a combination of differential drag and onboard propulsion. A pathfinder mission, supported by this project will use 3 identical CubeSats to demonstrate the SWARM-EX key technologies and address scientific questions related to the evolution of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) and equatorial thermospheric anomaly (ETA).  The specific aeronomy questions are 1) How persistent and correlated are the plasma density and neutral oxygen in EIA and ETA features?; 2) Over what timescales, less than 90 minutes, do we observe changes in EIA/ETA properties due to non-migrating tides and geomagnetic activity?  These CubeSats will demonstrate novel technology including RF cross-links, propulsion, CDMA X-band data downlinks and on-board autonomy.

As a magnetic star, our Sun has disrupted, and will continue to threaten disrupting, these technology-dependent activities.  In order to mitigate the inevitable risks, it is vital that we advance our understanding of the processes behind events such as flares and coronal mass ejections (CME).  The solar magnetic field that underlies all of these phenomena arises from the flows present in the solar plasma.  These flows are produced by the transport of energy through the solar interior.  This 3-year research project is expected to improve our knowledge of the structure, dynamics and flows immediately below the surface of the Sun.  This region is key to understanding and predicting solar activity.  This research project features not only important academic research, but also promises a tangible and concrete benefit to our technologically powered society.<br/><br/>This 3-year project is aimed at a better characterization of the Sun's near-surface layers (outermost 5% of the solar interior) using helioseismic techniques.  A key question that this work will contribute to answering is: how and why does the Sun (and other Sun-like stars) vary?  Using helioseismology, the project team will be able to infer and constrain changes in the structure and dynamics of the solar interior by extending the precise characterization of p-mode (or pressure-mode) oscillations to higher spatial degrees and tracking their changes with time.  The technical aspect of this project is to derive accurate characteristics of high-degree modes, i.e., precise and unbiased estimates of mode frequency, line width, asymmetry and amplitude for spherical harmonics degrees in the range 200-900, using NSO's Global Oscillations Network Group (GONG) observations.  The research work to be carried out would enhance the scientific return of the GONG mission, which has been supported by the NSF.

However, platform marshes are now endangered due to accelerating sea-level rise and diminished sediment supplies, which together may lead to their drowning. This project will study how major storms help the sustainability of marshes by transferring sediment from the coastal zone and depositing it in a widespread layer on top of the marsh. This sediment layer (an inch or more) helps the marsh to accrete vertically, fertilizes the marsh with nutrients, and enhances the productivity of the salt marsh grasses. This research will produce an understanding of how storms source these sediments and how characteristics of the nearshore and marsh system influence the direction of floodwaters and the resulting distribution and deposition of the suspended sediment. As a broader impacts activity, the investigators will design and facilitate a graduate-level course on the Interaction of Storms with the Coastline, covering aspects of hydrodynamics, sediment dynamics, geomorphology, ecology, human geography, and economics as they relate to storm impacts. Additional broader impacts include: 1) fostering new and existing relationships with local stakeholders (including the Georgia Coastal Ecosystems Long Term Ecological Research site) to facilitate data exchange, cultivate collaboration, and disseminate findings, 2) maintaining a project website presenting details of the motivation, progress, the graduate course, and providing links to data products; 3) training one postdoctoral researcher, one Ph.D. student, and at least two undergraduate students and two high school interns; and 4) direct outreach to the public through development of hands-on K-12 learning activities to be implemented at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science.<br/><br/>The study leverages a suite of sediment cores and marsh surface samples collected behind Sapelo Island, Georgia, in December 2017 to quantify the provenance of sediment deposits associated with Hurricane Irma (supported by a RAPID grant from the NSF Geomorphology and Land-use Dynamics Program). Post-Irma data will be supplemented with additional samples from potential sediment sources within nearshore, backbarrier (channel; bay floor; tidal flat; marsh-edge erosion), and fluvial environments. The relative sediment contributions from each of these sources to the storm deposit will be determined using a novel combination of sedimentologic (e.g., grain size, loss-on- ignition, foraminifera content) and geochemical (biomarker compositions, bulk-sediment and biomarker stable- and radio- isotopic compositions) proxies analyzed through principal component analysis and non- metric multi-dimensional scaling statistics. Relationships among storm-surge elevation, local flow patterns, deposit thickness, and sediment provenance will be analyzed using multi-dimensional statistical tools. These data will then be used in conjunction with a Delft3D model, which can simulate hydrodynamics, sediment transport, and resulting sedimentation patterns during Irma and other storm conditions, to: 1) explore the source of storm deposits across a range of backbarrier subenvironments, 2) determine the relative importance of nearshore, backbarrier, and fluvial reservoirs in providing sediment to saltmarshes during major storms, 3) quantify the processes, pathways, and mechanisms of sediment distribution to the marsh platform (e.g., storm-surge level and duration, wave exposure, local geomorphology, and river sediment discharge), and 4) evaluate the importance of storm sedimentation relative to long-term vertical marsh accretion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current paradigms suggest that this productivity is driven by several upwelling mechanisms at the shelf break front. This upwelling supplies nutrients that stimulate primary production by phytoplankton, which in turn leads to enhanced production at higher trophic levels. Although local enhancement of phytoplankton biomass has been observed in some circumstances, such a feature is curiously absent from time-averaged measurements, both from satellites and shipboard sampling. Why would there not be a mean enhancement in phytoplankton biomass as a result of the upwelling? One hypothesis is that grazing by zooplankton prevents accumulation of biomass on seasonal and longer time scales, transferring the excess production to higher trophic levels and thereby contributing to the overall productivity of the ecosystem. However, another possibility is that the net impact of these highly intermittent processes is not adequately represented in long-term means of the observations, because of the relatively low resolution of the in-water measurements and the fact that the frontal enhancement can take place below the depth observable by satellite.  The deployment of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Pioneer Array south of New England has provided a unique opportunity to test these hypotheses. The combination of moored instrumentation and autonomous underwater vehicles will facilitate observations of the frontal system with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. This will provide an ideal four-dimensional (space-time) context in which to conduct a detailed study of frontal dynamics and plankton communities needed to examine mechanisms controlling phytoplankton populations in this frontal system.  This project will also: (1) promote teaching, training and learning via participation of graduate and undergraduate students in the research , (2) provide a broad dissemination of information by means of outreach in public fora, printed media, and a video documentary of the field work, and (3) contribute to improving societal well-being and increased economic competitiveness by providing the knowledge needed for science-based stewardship of coastal ecosystems, with particular emphasis on connecting with the fishing industry through the Commercial Fisheries Research Foundation.<br/><br/>The investigators will conduct a set of three cruises to obtain cross-shelf sections of physical, chemical, and biological properties within the Pioneer Array. Nutrient distributions will be assayed together with hydrography to detect the signature of frontal upwelling and associated nutrient supply. The investigators expect that enhanced nutrient supply will lead to changes in the phytoplankton assemblage, which will be quantified with conventional flow cytometry, imaging flow cytometry (Imaging FlowCytobot, IFCB), optical imaging (Video Plankton Recorder, VPR), traditional microscopic methods, and pigment analysis. Zooplankton will be measured in size classes ranging from micro- to mesozooplankton with the IFCB and VPR, respectively, and also with microscopic analysis. Biological responses to upwelling will be assessed by measuring rates of primary productivity, zooplankton grazing, and net community production. These observations will be synthesized in the context of a coupled physical-biological model to test the two hypotheses that can potentially explain prior observations: (1) grazer-mediated control and (2) undersampling. Hindcast simulations will also be used to diagnose the relative importance of the various mechanisms of upwelling.  The intellectual merit of this effort stems from our interdisciplinary approach, advanced observational techniques, and integrated analysis in the context of a state-of-the-art coupled model. The project will address longstanding questions regarding hydrodynamics and productivity of an important ecosystem, leading to improved understanding of physical-biological interactions in a complex continental shelf regime. Given the importance of frontal systems in the global coastal ocean, it is expected that knowledge gained will have broad applicability beyond the specific region being studied."

The Airborne Stabilized Platform for InfraRed Experiments (ASPIRE) builds on the success of the Airborne InfraRed Spectrometer (AIR-Spec), turning the GV into a solar-viewing platform for rapid prototyping of solar and atmospheric instruments.  By adding a stabilized solar feed to the GV aircraft, the project team will create an airborne platform for infrared remote sensing that will be a valuable resource for both the solar and atmospheric communities.  In solar physics, the 20cm feed would enable many applications on and off the solar disk.  During the upcoming eclipse mission, for example, the ASPIRE will provide enough throughput to make polarimetric measurements with an airborne version of the Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter (CoMP).  The project team will deliver the ASPIRE interface documentation to NSF and NCAR in first quarter 2021.  The ASPIRE project will provide research training for at least three REU students at the Smithsonian Institution Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) over its lifetime.  The team will involve a Boston-based undergraduate in the ASPIRE development and bring this student to Chile to participate in various EPO activities.  Summer test flights in 2020 and 2021 will provide field testing experience for two REU students.  Combining a total solar eclipse with the GV research aircraft is an excellent way to captivate public interest.  As both the 2019 and 2020 eclipses cross South America, the SAO and NCAR staff will reach out to U.S. Embassy personnel to arrange tours of the unique GV aircraft and give talks on eclipse science.<br/><br/>The main goal of this three-year MRI project is to develop the ASPIRE, which will provide a 20cm diameter solar feed, stabilized to <5 arcsec RMS over a 3 second exposure time.  The platform is well-suited for infrared investigations of the Sun, as it can operate above the influence of Earth's atmosphere, and for atmospheric measurements of trace gases obtained by observing sunlight transmitted through atmospheric absorption bands.  The ASPIRE will provide broadband visible and infrared transmission from 0.45 to 10 microns, compatible with all of the GV's IR-transmissive viewports.  During its 2020 commissioning flight, ASPIRE will feed a 13cm telescope with two complementary focal plane instruments: AIR-Spec (an imaging spectrometer) and a new narrowband imager centered on the AIR-Spec 1.43 micron Si X line. AIR-Spec was designed to characterize five magnetically sensitive coronal emission lines between 1.4 and 4 microns and assess whether they are useful probes of coronal magnetism.  It observed all five of its target lines during the 2017 total solar eclipse, detecting the 2.84 micron Fe IX for the first time.  The strong Si X line was observed up to 0.6 solar radii from the limb and provided line-of-sight velocity measurements with a resolution of 5 km/s. The larger telescope aperture enabled by ASPIRE will improve the AIR-Spec SNR by a factor of 1.5 compared to its 2019 observation (>6x improvement over 2017), allowing the project team to explore the coronal density and temperature measurements, flows, and oscillations that are on the edge of detection with the current AIR-Spec instrumentation.  The Si X context imager will reduce the need for rastering the slit, allowing us to improve SNR by summing 'sit and stare' slit data for more than a minute.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are the largest energy-release events in the solar system and the main driver of space weather disturbances at Earth.  When directed towards the Earth, they can adversely affect human endeavors such as air traffic communications, power grids, and satellites, and be hazardous to astronauts traveling in space.  It is therefore important to understand the physics behind these powerful events.  It is widely accepted that the sudden and violent reconfiguration of magnetic fields is the main process that enables the release of energy in solar eruptions.  However, the details of the conversion of magnetic energy into heating and plasma motion are not well understood.  In this three-year project, state-of-the-art computer simulations together with satellite observations will be employed to make progress on this important problem, by modeling and systematically investigating energy transfer and plasma heating in flares and CMEs.  The project will support the dissertation research of a PhD student and thus foster the educational goals of the NSF.<br/><br/>This three-year project will employ sophisticated magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) numerical simulations to model solar eruptions (for both idealized and observed cases).  The simulation results will be used to identify the physical mechanisms responsible for energy conversion and plasma heating during eruptions and to quantify their respective contributions.  These numerical investigations will be complemented with detailed analysis of high-cadence and high-resolution observations from current spacecraft, using well-developed analysis tools for deriving thermal information from observational data.  This project aims to answer several open questions about solar eruptions.  First of all, it will examine the physical mechanisms that heat plasma during the impulsive phase of solar flares and quantify the energy partition in this phase.  Secondly, it will explore the physical mechanisms responsible for heating plasma in the region of the current sheet in the late phase of solar flares.  Thirdly, it will investigate how the recently discovered ""hot plasma channels"" are formed and heated to temperatures of more than 10 million degrees Kelvin in the early stages of an eruption.  Finally, it will examine how erupting plasma is heated and evolves during its propagation within a CME.

This volcanic ash (also called tephra) is deposited on land or in water bodies, and may become preserved in the geological record. Studies of tephra are important for a wide range of purposes including learning about the eruptive history of a volcano to anticipate potential future behavior, and correlating and dating rock layers for paleoanthropology and paleoclimatology studies. Traditionally, much of this work has been carried out by separate groups of researchers from these various disciplines, and a significant amount of data is then published in specialized literature, and hard to discover. A centralized database of tephra occurrence in East Africa would help overcome this barrier and encourage the use of existing valuable datasets, but also answer fundamental questions about the evolution of volcanism in East Africa through time. This project will address this need by building the East African Rift Tephra Database (EARThD), a comprehensive database that will integrate, standardize, and investigate geochemical and age tephra datasets from the East African Rift focusing on the record from the past 5 million years. <br/><br/>The EARThD project will utilize the existing NSF-supported community-based data facility, Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance (IEDA), to store, curate, and provide access to geochemical data and metadata through IEDA's EarthChem library. Tephra samples from published articles will be assigned an International Sample Geo Number (IGSN) and associated datasets and metadata will be entered and formatted using standardized IEDA templates. The development of EARThD will fulfill the currently non-existent but crucial data integration and standardization effort needed to support the growing East African Rift tephra record and the increasingly complex and interdisciplinary research questions being studied. It will benefit a broad scientific community by encouraging and facilitating the cross-disciplinary use of tephra geochemical data and involve undergraduate student researchers. Results of this project will provide a clearer understanding of the temporal variations of explosive volcanism along the East African Rift, including the frequency and magnitude of past eruptions and long-term geochemical variations in response to continental rifting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The principal strengths of SIMS relative to other micro-analytical techniques are its high spatial resolution and the capability for high-precision measurements of both concentration and isotopic composition of light elements such as hydrogen, lithium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. The analytical capabilities and expertise of the NENIMF are focused in two areas: determination of magmatic volatiles in silicate glasses and analysis of biogenic carbonates as records of climate change and its impacts on marine organisms, making the NENIMF a unique interdisciplinary resource to the geosciences community, with minimal overlap to the other National SIMS Facilities. Since January 2011, the NENIMF has accommodated 93 users from 47 different institutions, including 14 users from institutions outside the United States. Over the past 22 years, a total of 328 peer reviewed scientific papers have been published using data collected at the NENIMF for an average of 15 publications per year.<br/><br/>The NENIMF is equipped with two Cameca SIMS instruments: an IMS 1280 and an IMS 3f. The IMS 1280 is a double focusing mass spectrometer with a large radius magnetic sector (585 mm), and ion optics optimized to attain a mass resolving power (MRP= M/delta M) of 6,000 without significant loss of secondary ion intensity. The IMS 3f is a double focusing mass spectrometer with a small radius magnetic sector that has been used for a wide spectrum of geochemical studies since 1978 and has been upgraded to Linux-based computer control of many components via Labview-based software (LabSIMS). The combination of these 2 instruments and the technical and scientific expertise of the NENIMF provides the geoscience community with a unique resource. Publications related to magmatic volatiles comprised 69% of the NENIMF total over the past 5 years, while 13% were focused on biogenic carbonates. In addition to these areas of specialization, NENIMF users have taken advantage of the Cameca IMS 1280 to work on a range of topics that include B isotopes in MORB glasses and subduction zone minerals, Zr in rutile geospeedometry, Ti diffusion in quartz, and U-Th-Pb dating of monazite and zircon. New analytical protocols developed at the NENIMF over the past few years include high-precision analysis of the isotopic composition of boron in low concentration basaltic glasses, and determination of D/H in the accessory mineral apatite. Support for the NENIMF meets the NSF Broader Impacts criteria in several different ways. Discovery and understanding are advanced while promoting teaching, training, and learning and participation of underrepresented groups is broadened through the involvement of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs. WHOI Undergraduate Summer Student Fellows, Postdoctoral Scholars, and WHOI/MIT Joint Program graduate students are specifically targeted for involvement in research projects with NENIMF personnel and WHOI faculty in which they are intimately involved with SIMS techniques. Involvement of young scientists in SIMS-based research is encouraged through annual short-courses. Infrastructure for research and education are enhanced through making both our existing analytical platforms, and those to be developed by the NENIMF personnel during the funding period, available to scientists and students from diverse disciplines. Research results are disseminated broadly to enhance scientific and technological understanding through an average of 15 publications per year that result from use of the facility.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent observations, compared to observations made 20-30 years before, indicate that both ice shelves (thick ice with ocean below) and land ice (thick ice with land below), are now melting at a much faster rate. Some numerical models suggest that significant ice retreat may begin within many of our lifetimes, starting with the abrupt collapse of Pine Island and Thwaites Glaciers in the next 50 years. This may be followed by retreat of much of the WAIS and then the collapse of parts of the East Antarctic ice sheet (EAIS). This research project will assess the extent to which global ocean circulation and climate will be impacted if enormous volumes of fresh water and ice flow into the Southern Ocean. It will establish whether a rapid collapse of WAIS in the near-future poses any significant threat to the stability of modern-day climate and human society. This is a topic that has so far received little attention as most prior research has focused on the response of climate to melting the Greenland ice sheet. Yet model simulations predict that the volumes of fresh water and ice released from Antarctica in the next few centuries could be up at least ten-times larger than from Greenland. The Intellectual Merit of this project stems from its ability to establish a link between the physical Antarctic system (ice sheet dynamics, fresh water discharge and iceberg calving) and global climate. The PIs (Principal Investigators) will assess the sensitivity of ocean circulation and climate to increased ice sheet melt using a combination of ocean, iceberg, ice sheet and climate models. Results from this study will help identify areas of the ice sheet that are vulnerable to collapse and also regions of the ocean where a significant freshening will have a considerable impact on climate, and serve to guide the deployment of an observational monitoring system capable of warning us when ice and fresh water discharge start to approach levels capable of disrupting ocean circulation and global climate. This project will support and train two graduate students, and each PI will be involved with local primary and secondary schools, making presentations, mentoring science fair projects, and contributing to curriculum development. A novel, web-based, interactive, cryosphere learning tool will be developed to help make school children more aware of the importance of the Polar Regions in global climate, and this software will be introduced to science teachers at a half day workshop organized by the UMass STEM Education Institute. <br/><br/>Recent numerical simulations using a continental ice sheet/shelf model show the potential for more rapid and greater Antarctic ice sheet retreat in the next 50-300 years (under the full range of IPCC RCP (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Representative Concentration Pathways) future warming scenarios) than previously projected. Exactly how the release of enormous volumes of ice and fresh water to the Southern Ocean will impact global ocean circulation and climate has yet to be accurately assessed. This is in part because previous model simulations were too coarse to accurately resolve narrow coastal boundary currents, shelf breaks, fronts, and mesoscale eddies that are all very important for realistically simulating fresh water transport in the ocean. In this award, future projections of fresh water discharge and iceberg calving from Antarctic will be used to force a high resolution eddy-resolving ocean model (MITgcm) coupled to a new iceberg module and a fully-coupled global climate model (CCSM4). High resolution ocean/iceberg simulations will determine the role of mesoscale eddies in freshwater transport and give new insight into how fresh water is advected to far-field locations, including deep water formation sites in the North Atlantic. These simulations will provide detailed information about subsurface temperatures and changes in ocean circulation close to the ice front and grounding line. An accompanying set of fully coupled climate model simulations (NCAR CCSM4) will identify multidecadal-to-centennial changes in the climate system triggered by increased high-latitude Southern Ocean freshwater forcing. Particular attention will be given to changes in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), wind stress, sea ice formation, and global temperatures. In doing so, this project will more accurately determine whether abrupt and potentially catastrophic changes in global climate are likely to be triggered by changes in the Antarctic system in the near-future."

Current paradigms suggest that this productivity is driven by several upwelling mechanisms at the shelf break front. This upwelling supplies nutrients that stimulate primary production by phytoplankton, which in turn leads to enhanced production at higher trophic levels. Although local enhancement of phytoplankton biomass has been observed in some circumstances, such a feature is curiously absent from time-averaged measurements, both from satellites and shipboard sampling. Why would there not be a mean enhancement in phytoplankton biomass as a result of the upwelling?

This 5-year CAREER project will study disease prevalence and intensity in two marine foundation species - the seagrass Zostera marina and the Eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. More specifically, host-disease relationships will be explored to understand how genetic diversity and population density of the host species impacts disease transmission and risk. This work will pair large-scale experimental restorations and smaller-scale field experiments to examine disease-host relationships across multiple spatial scales. Comparisons of patterns and mechanisms across the two coastal systems will provide an important first step towards identifying generalities in the diversity-density-disease relationship. To enhance the broader impacts and utility of this work, the experiments will be conducted in collaboration with restoration practitioners and guided by knowledge ascertained from key stakeholder groups. The project will support the development of an early career female researcher and multiple graduate and undergraduate students. Students will be trained in state-of-the-art molecular techniques to quantify oyster and seagrass parasites. Key findings from the surveys and experimental work will be incorporated into undergraduate courses focused on Conservation Biology, Marine Biology, and Disease Ecology. Finally, students in these courses will help develop social-ecological surveys and mutual learning games to stimulate knowledge transfer with stakeholders through a series of workshops.<br/><br/>The relationship between host genetic diversity and disease dynamics is complex.  In some cases, known as a dilution effect, diversity reduces disease transmission and risk. However, the opposite relationship, known as the amplification effect, can also occur when diversity increases the risk of infection. Even if diversity directly reduces disease risk, simultaneous positive effects of diversity on host density could lead to amplification by increasing disease transmission between infected and uninfected individuals. Large-scale field restorations of seagrasses (Zostera marina) and oysters (Crassostrea virginica) will be utilized to test the effects of host genetic diversity on host population density and disease prevalence/intensity. Additional field experiments independently manipulating host genetic diversity and density will examine the mechanisms leading to dilution or amplification. Conducting similar manipulations in two marine foundation species - one a clonal plant and the other a non-clonal animal - will help identify commonalities in the diversity-density-disease relationship. Further, collaborations among project scientists, students, and stakeholders will enhance interdisciplinary training and help facilitate the exchange of information to improve management and restoration efforts. As part of these efforts, targeted surveys will be used to document the perceptions and attitudes of managers and restoration practitioners regarding genetic diversity and its role in ecological resilience and restoration."

The surface ocean was colder, the atmosphere was windier, there was far less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and sea level was 300 feet lower.  Operation of the modern North Atlantic Ocean has been likened to a conveyor belt, where warm salty waters of Gulf Stream origin enter the Norwegian Sea and release heat to the atmosphere that keeps northern Europe warm.  After losing their heat, surface waters sink to the bottom and flow out of the Nordic Seas and into the deep North Atlantic basin.  For over three decades oceanographers and climatologists have known that this conveyor belt was interrupted at times in the past, especially during the last ice age.  Instead of deep northern water in the North Atlantic, analysis of the chemical make-up of fossil shells in marine sediment cores shows that the deep waters had a southern (Antarctic) source.  This view of the glacial North Atlantic has become a paradigm.  Recent findings from cores in the very deep basins of the North Atlantic have challenged that conventional wisdom, suggesting that there was a northern source of bottom water after all.  This project seeks to confirm that finding by collecting and analyzing new sediment cores from the deepest basins of the North Atlantic (>5000 meters). Results could significantly change, or even overturn, our understanding of how the glacial North Atlantic distributed heat, salt, nutrients, and CO2.  Furthermore, because glacial age data are used to test modern climate models under different scenarios, the proposed new research could lead to refinement of models that predict future climate changes.  The research expedition will have about eight berths for early career professionals who are interested in learning methods of seafloor surveying and sampling, and the long sediment cores to be collected will be archived and readily available for sampling by many diverse scientists. The project will also involve international collaboration with a German research team.<br/><br/>The centerpiece of the research is an expedition to the western North Atlantic between Cape Cod, MA and the Azores to survey the very deep seafloor for new coring locations and to sample them with different devices  (multicorers, gravity corers, and piston corers).  Changes in deep ocean circulation will be traced using carbon isotope ratios in shells of fossil planktonic and benthic foraminifera.  The 13C/12C ratio is a proxy for deep water nutrient content, and at core sites around 4.2 km this ratio shows that during glaciation the mixture of waters from the Arctic and Antarctic was different than today and consistent with current thinking.  Most likely, either the northern source produced less water because the surface in the Nordic seas was more covered with sea ice than today, or the deep water traveled more slowly and accumulated more nutrients from the surface.  Existing 14C/12C data support the pattern seen in 13C/12C, and this tracer is also used to date the sediment deposits.  However, below 4200 m, the pattern of these isotope pairs reverses and indicates more northern source waters with increasing depth (to 5 km).  This hypothesis will be tested with coring and shore-based analytical work on sites from between 3 km and >5 km. Data from new core sites above 3 km will be collected by a German colleague, and the collaboration will result in the first high resolution depth reconstructions past hydrographic changes in the western basin of the North Atlantic."

In particular, the project will explore the relationship between small-scale energy release in the form of outflows in the current sheet region and the large-scale transport of thermal energy in the flare structure.  The integrated modeling efforts will form the basis of the development of a more sophisticated, full three-dimensional (3-D) simulation of solar eruptions in the future.<br/><br/>The 3-year research program integrates two sets of well-developed, state-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations:  one simulation models the large-scale structure and evolution of solar flares, whereas the other simulation targets detailed dynamics in and around the reconnection current sheet region at small scales.  The large-scale flare simulation will be used to set up the context and initial conditions for the detailed full 3-D simulation of the reconnection region.  The outputs of the detailed small scale 3-D simulation, in turn, will provide feedback and update the large-scale simulation to evaluate the consequences of small-scale energy release processes.  The modeling results will be compared with extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray observations to test and improve our understanding of the energy release and conversion processes from small to large scales.  A variety of well observed, but poorly understood phenomena that are closely tied to the energy release processes will be investigated and compared to model outputs, including supra-arcade down-flows and other fast plasma outflows, current-sheet like structures above flare loops, and hot loop-top EUV/X-ray sources.<br/><br/>The improved knowledge on the origin of solar eruptions is critical to understand basic science needed to meet the goals of the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan, which aims to develop tools to forecast space weather and mitigate its impacts.

Carbon is transferred from the surface of the Earth into the mantle by the process of plate subduction, where oceanic plates carrying carbon-rich rocks and sediments sink into the mantle. During the initial stages of subduction, some fraction of the carbon in the sinking plate is removed and transported back to the Earth's surface in the magmas of subduction-zone volcanoes, such as those of the Pacific Ring of Fire. To account for the mass balance of the carbon cycle, and to fully understand variations in Earth's climate on geological time scales, it is therefore necessary to determine how much subducting carbon is rapidly returned  back to Earth's surface, and how much is instead transported deep into the mantle. Rates of carbon recycling are difficult to measure directly, however, because carbon dissolved in magmas is sequestered into a separate vapor phase during magmatic ascent, traversing through the crust and into the atmosphere at highly variable rates, and via diffuse pathways. As an alternative to direct measurements of carbon fluxes through subduction zone volcanoes, geochemical proxies can be used to estimate the amount of carbon that was initially present in the magmas. This study will incorporate recent advances in analytical techniques that will use the strontium isotope system as a proxy, with applications to carbonate recycling in particular. The proposed work aims to advance understanding of chemical cycling at subduction zones while promoting teaching, training, and learning. This project involves mentoring of early-career researchers from under-represented groups in the Earth sciences, as well as a first-year Master's student. The proposed work also will build new collaborative relationships among early career faculty members of UMass Amherst and Washington University in St. Louis.<br/><br/>Strontium is a potentially powerful proxy of carbonate recycling though subduction zones because it is typically present at high abundances in carbonates relative to the mantle, and because carbonates have distinct stable Sr isotope compositions. The project team will develop new procedures for the analysis and interpretation of the Sr stable isotope system among igneous rocks from volcanic arcs by building a data framework in the Central American Volcanic Arc (CAVA), where there is a thick layer of subducting sedimentary carbonate, the volcanic rocks and gases have been extensively measured and characterized by previous studies, and there is good geochemical evidence for variable carbonate recycling efficiency. Combined measurements of Sr stable and radiogenic isotope ratios via double-spike TIMS will provide the ability to accurately estimate the Sr flux from the subducting carbonate to the volcanic arc, which can in turn be used to estimate the rates of carbon recycling. If successful, this study will provide novel constraints on the global carbon cycle, establish &#948;88/86Sr isotope systematics among subducting components and their associated volcanics, and provide the basis for further studies of arc geochemical transport. &#948;88/86Sr values will be combined with radiogenic Sr isotopes to accurately determine the total carbonate-derived Sr budget of the arc volcanics and whether these systems can be used to assess the efficiency of, and the mechanisms that enable, the recycling of subducting carbonate into volcanic arcs. If the &#948;88/86Sr system at CAVA provides a benchmark on carbon recycling through volcanic arcs, then these tracers can be used to constrain the fate of subducted carbonate in other arcs around the world. Once modern-day stable Sr isotope arc systematics are established, this proxy can also potentially be used to assess the variability of subducting carbonate in past eras, providing transformative insight into the variability of the global carbon cycle throughout Earth's history. The results of the proposed work will be of interest to the wide geoscience community, including low-temperature geochemistry and Earth history communities interested in long-term variations in surface carbon reservoirs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This opened a new window of opportunity for high resolutions thermal IR spectroscopy of the Sun's corona on a platform that avoids the vast majority of the atmospheric absorption.   The 2017 AIR-Spec eclipse observations revealed all of the target coronal emission lines at several coronal positions, showed Hydrogen lines in the prominence observations and captured the chromospheric flash spectrum.<br/><br/>This three-year project is intended to re-fly the AIR-Spec instrument during the 2019 July 2 total solar eclipse in the south Pacific off the coast of Chile.  During this project, the AIR-Spec will be upgraded to have an improved sensitivity, image stability, and automation of the data collection process.  The goal is to characterize the thermal IR emission of Sun's corona, including an investigation of numerous coronal IR emission lines, across a variety of solar structures (coronal holes, plumes, prominences, etc.) on an otherwise almost unexplored physical regime.  The project's primary personnel are two very early-career women (one scientist, one engineer), and additional REU students will be involved -- including for the flight preparations themselves.  The project team is committed to fostering diversity and inclusion while training the next generation of instrumentation scientists and engineers in the U.S.   <br/><br/>The first AIR-Spec flight succeeded in measuring all targeted five infrared (IR) coronal emission lines, including the first-of-its-kind measurement of the coronal Fe IX line at 2.845 microns.

Current paradigms suggest that this productivity is driven by several upwelling mechanisms at the shelf break front. This upwelling supplies nutrients that stimulate primary production by phytoplankton, which in turn leads to enhanced production at higher trophic levels. Although local enhancement of phytoplankton biomass has been observed in some circumstances, such a feature is curiously absent from time-averaged measurements, both from satellites and shipboard sampling. Why would there not be a mean enhancement in phytoplankton biomass as a result of the upwelling? One hypothesis is that grazing by zooplankton prevents accumulation of biomass on seasonal and longer time scales, transferring the excess production to higher trophic levels and thereby contributing to the overall productivity of the ecosystem. However, another possibility is that the net impact of these highly intermittent processes is not adequately represented in long-term means of the observations, because of the relatively low resolution of the in-water measurements and the fact that the frontal enhancement can take place below the depth observable by satellite.  The deployment of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) Pioneer Array south of New England has provided a unique opportunity to test these hypotheses. The combination of moored instrumentation and autonomous underwater vehicles will facilitate observations of the frontal system with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. This will provide an ideal four-dimensional (space-time) context in which to conduct a detailed study of frontal dynamics and plankton communities needed to examine mechanisms controlling phytoplankton populations in this frontal system.  This project will also: (1) promote teaching, training and learning via participation of graduate and undergraduate students in the research , (2) provide a broad dissemination of information by means of outreach in public fora, printed media, and a video documentary of the field work, and (3) contribute to improving societal well-being and increased economic competitiveness by providing the knowledge needed for science-based stewardship of coastal ecosystems, with particular emphasis on connecting with the fishing industry through the Commercial Fisheries Research Foundation.<br/><br/>The investigators will conduct a set of three cruises to obtain cross-shelf sections of physical, chemical, and biological properties within the Pioneer Array. Nutrient distributions will be assayed together with hydrography to detect the signature of frontal upwelling and associated nutrient supply. The investigators expect that enhanced nutrient supply will lead to changes in the phytoplankton assemblage, which will be quantified with conventional flow cytometry, imaging flow cytometry (Imaging FlowCytobot, IFCB), optical imaging (Video Plankton Recorder, VPR), traditional microscopic methods, and pigment analysis. Zooplankton will be measured in size classes ranging from micro- to mesozooplankton with the IFCB and VPR, respectively, and also with microscopic analysis. Biological responses to upwelling will be assessed by measuring rates of primary productivity, zooplankton grazing, and net community production. These observations will be synthesized in the context of a coupled physical-biological model to test the two hypotheses that can potentially explain prior observations: (1) grazer-mediated control and (2) undersampling. Hindcast simulations will also be used to diagnose the relative importance of the various mechanisms of upwelling.  The intellectual merit of this effort stems from our interdisciplinary approach, advanced observational techniques, and integrated analysis in the context of a state-of-the-art coupled model. The project will address longstanding questions regarding hydrodynamics and productivity of an important ecosystem, leading to improved understanding of physical-biological interactions in a complex continental shelf regime. Given the importance of frontal systems in the global coastal ocean, it is expected that knowledge gained will have broad applicability beyond the specific region being studied."

In the late nineteenth century, Sir George Nares came across 15-18 m thick, immobile, ice extending 480 km off the northern Ellesmere coast. The characteristics of the ice were very different from the 2-3 m thick ice now circulating the Arctic Ocean. Similar accounts from other arctic explorers from this time provided insight into what must surely have been a far thicker and more persistent ice cover over the Arctic Ocean during full glacial conditions than we see today. Indeed, low biological productivity and extremely low, or absent, sediment deposition in the Arctic during glacial periods suggest that parts of the central and western Arctic Ocean were covered by very thick, perennial ice. This research will explore how such ice could have covered much of the Arctic Ocean during glacial periods, how thick it could have been, and whether its eventual mobilization and demise could have produced freshwater output to the North Atlantic large enough to weaken the deep water formation and trigger abrupt climate cooling. Using a suite of sophisticated, high-resolution, coupled numerical model experiments, this group will address these questions and highlight the connection between changes in the Arctic hydrological cycle and global climate.<br/><br/>Each investigator has a serious commitment to education and public outreach, and the project will support and train a graduate student who will work with the investigators in all aspects of the research. Each investigator has been involved with local primary and secondary schools, either by making presentations, hiring students for the summer, mentoring science fair projects, or contributing to curriculum development. They will contribute to the on-going middle and high school science teacher training activities by developing a web-based, interactive, sea ice-learning tool to teach school children about the mechanisms behind sea ice formation and how ice will change as the arctic climate warms. In addition, well-developed relationships with local community organizations will help promote public understanding of abrupt climate change. The idea of thick sea ice in the Arctic has a remarkable ability to capture the public imagination in much the same way as it did in the Victorian period when explorers returned from the Arctic with tales of thick impenetrable ice, conveying the concept of the important role that the Arctic plays in global climate.<br/><br/><br/>Technical<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project stems from its ability to establish a link between the physical arctic system (circulation, sea ice, icebergs) and global climate. Numerical models have recently shown that freshwater sourced from the Arctic is twice as effective at disrupting climate than freshwater released from more southerly sources, but to the present the subject of freshwater and abrupt climate change has been dominated by discussion of meltwater floods emanating from glacial lake outbursts. Determining whether the export of sea ice and associated superimposed ice from the Arctic to the North Atlantic could supply enough freshwater to the Nordic Seas to cause the Earth's climate to cool will provide new insight into the mechanisms that trigger abrupt climate change. By quantifying the sensitivity of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation to arctic freshwater forcing the researchers will also be able to better examine whether changes in the arctic hydrological cycle in the near future (from sea ice melt and freshwater export from the Beaufort Gyre) pose a threat to the stability of modern-day climate and human society. In addition, the numerical model developed for this project will resolve ocean circulation, sea ice, and iceberg transport at a resolution approx. 0.17 degrees (ca. 19 km), 5-10 times higher than that of existing paleo-climate models, and have the capability of simulating narrow coastal boundary currents, shelf-breaks, and frontal zones important for freshwater transport along the continental margins, and other features not captured by the current generation of paleo-climate models."

Its involvement in photosynthesis and respiration links the changes of oxygen concentration to that of carbon in the ocean, and ultimately in the atmosphere. As the oceans take up more and more carbon, oxygen concentrations in the ocean are declining, with the potential to reach levels low enough to reduce biodiversity. The last ice age provides a natural experiment to investigate how oxygen concentrations may have varied under different climate conditions in order to help forecast what might happen in the future. Most previous studies have only been able to distinguish the relative change in oxygen concentrations (higher or lower), but in this project a new application will be developed that can quantitatively constrain oxygen concentrations in the past. In regions like the tropical Atlantic, where oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) approach but do not reach a total absence of oxygen today, it is critical to pinpoint the environmental conditions that can cross that threshold into an absence of oxygen. This project will promote training and learning for several participants, including one early-career scientist without previous NSF support and one undergraduate summer student.<br/><br/><br/>This project will produce high quality U-Th isotope and trace element data in a suite of intermediate depth sediment cores from the western tropical Atlantic and one site under the eastern tropical OMZ. These data will be used to test hypotheses regarding the evolution of bottom water oxygen concentrations (BW [O2]) during the last deglaciation in response to changes in the intensity of the eastern tropical OMZ. Specifically this project seeks to understand how the spatial extent and absolute magnitude of the OMZ has varied , and how these changes may relate to intermediate water ventilation and carbon storage. The first component of this proposal involves method development of a quantitative proxy system for BW [O2]. It parameterizes sedimentary [O2] with authigenic uranium and organic carbon fluxes with Baxs fluxes to generate a comprehensive approach to reconstructing BW [O2]. This component focuses on the Demerara Rise, where preliminary data indicate a high probability for successful application, and then it combines the new data from the Demerara Rise with additional work in the Arabian Sea and previously published data from the Pacific to prospect the global utility of the approach. The second component of this proposal investigates how and why oxygen concentrations in tropical intermediate waters may have varied in the past in response to changes in zonal circulation, meridional circulation, and organic matter fluxes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, significant uncertainty in projections of future hurricane risk exist because the climatic drivers of changes in hurricane activity is poorly known. This is exacerbated by the exceedingly short instrumental record of hurricane occurrence in the western Atlantic, which makes diagnosing the climatic controls on hurricane activity difficult. This project utilizes historical and long-term geological reconstructions of hurricane activity in the western North Atlantic, which extends our knowledge of hurricane occurrence back centuries and even millennia. This approach allows assessment of how the risk posed by hurricanes along the east coast of the United States has changed. Further, the researchers will use state of the art numerical models to both diagnose the key climatic conditions that contribute to changes in hurricane activity and to provide improved projections of future hurricane risk. Many of the lessons learned from this work will be used by the broader scientific community and planners and decision-makers to improve our preparedness and resilience to possible future changes in hurricane risk.  The results will inform risk modeling, which in turn informs the insurance and re-insurance industries, as well as efforts to mitigate tropical cyclone hazards at the city, state and federal levels. Finally, the project will provide the opportunity to train and educate the next generation of scientists with the engagement of graduate, undergraduate and high school students.<br/><br/>This study takes an integrated research approach that addresses two broad questions: 1) How is the risk of floods changing due to (a) storm surge and (b) rainfall? 2) How do processes like changes in ocean circulations (e.g., Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation) and the response to low latitude volcanic eruptions modulate hurricane activity, both generally and specifically for US landfalling storms? Reconstruction of past changes in hurricane landfalls along the Northeast US, Florida east coast, and northwestern Gulf of Mexico will be coupled with hydrodynamic modeling of tropical cyclone related storm surges and waves and downscaled estimates of TC-related rainfall. This approach will allow determination of changes in risk of TC-induced flooding over the last millennium. This will form the baseline for examining future risk and for examining critical forcing mechanisms that may significantly alter future regional landfall probabilities. Downscaling the latest (CMIP6) global model output coupled with hydrodynamic modeling of surge and waves will be used to assess current and future risk of TC-induced flooding.

Oceanographers have usually thought that the growth of these nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria is limited at any particular time and place by the supply of either iron, or of phosphorus. Preliminary experiments have shown, though, that these nitrogen fixers instead grow best when both iron and phosphorus are scarce at the same time. In this project, the researchers will use cellular indicators that are specific for iron and phosphorus limitation to determine how important this type of ""balanced limitation"" of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria is in controlling the productivity of ocean food chains in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Two graduate students will be trained at the University of Southern California (USC) and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, as well as a postdoctoral researcher at USC. Educational outreach efforts will take place at a Los Angeles inner city high school with a student body that is over 98% Hispanic and African-American, and with underrepresented undergraduates in the USC Global Environmental Microbiology course. In addition, two Research Experiences for Undergraduates students will be supervised for summer research projects to help them learn about science career options. <br/><br/>The researchers will investigate the biological and biogeochemical consequences of this unique balanced iron/phosphorus-limited phenotype, using both laboratory and fieldwork approaches. During the first year of this project, the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria will be cultured under iron and/or phosphorus limitation, followed by application of proteomics and transcriptomics to identify genes that are potential diagnostic biomarkers for iron/phosphorus balanced limitation. Preliminary work has already identified one promising candidate biomarker in one cyanobacterium, an EzrA protein domain that appears to be associated with the cell size decreases seen specifically under balanced limitation, and the researchers have identified numerous other potential candidates for similar biomarkers. During the second year, these new co-limitation biomarkers and others previously validated for iron limitation (IsiB) and phosphorus limitation (SphX) will be used to investigate balanced limitation during a research cruise transecting from relatively high-iron, low-phosphorus North Atlantic waters, to the relatively high-phosphorus, low-iron South Atlantic. This fieldwork component will survey nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria populations across this natural iron/phosphorus gradient for genetic, proteomic, and physiological indicators of balanced limitation, as well as testing their responses to iron and phosphorus manipulations in shipboard incubation experiments. The third year will be devoted to sample analysis, and publications exploring the responses of oceanic nitrogen fixers to simultaneous limitation by both iron and phosphorus."

Unfortunately, significant uncertainty in projections of future hurricane risk exist because the climatic drivers of changes in hurricane activity is poorly known. This is exacerbated by the exceedingly short instrumental record of hurricane occurrence in the western Atlantic, which makes diagnosing the climatic controls on hurricane activity difficult. This project utilizes historical and long-term geological reconstructions of hurricane activity in the western North Atlantic, which extends our knowledge of hurricane occurrence back centuries and even millennia. This approach allows assessment of how the risk posed by hurricanes along the east coast of the United States has changed. Further, the researchers will use state of the art numerical models to both diagnose the key climatic conditions that contribute to changes in hurricane activity and to provide improved projections of future hurricane risk. Many of the lessons learned from this work will be used by the broader scientific community and planners and decision-makers to improve our preparedness and resilience to possible future changes in hurricane risk.  The results will inform risk modeling, which in turn informs the insurance and re-insurance industries, as well as efforts to mitigate tropical cyclone hazards at the city, state and federal levels. Finally, the project will provide the opportunity to train and educate the next generation of scientists with the engagement of graduate, undergraduate and high school students.<br/><br/>This study takes an integrated research approach that addresses two broad questions: 1) How is the risk of floods changing due to (a) storm surge and (b) rainfall? 2) How do processes like changes in ocean circulations (e.g., Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation) and the response to low latitude volcanic eruptions modulate hurricane activity, both generally and specifically for US landfalling storms? Reconstruction of past changes in hurricane landfalls along the Northeast US, Florida east coast, and northwestern Gulf of Mexico will be coupled with hydrodynamic modeling of tropical cyclone related storm surges and waves and downscaled estimates of TC-related rainfall. This approach will allow determination of changes in risk of TC-induced flooding over the last millennium. This will form the baseline for examining future risk and for examining critical forcing mechanisms that may significantly alter future regional landfall probabilities. Downscaling the latest (CMIP6) global model output coupled with hydrodynamic modeling of surge and waves will be used to assess current and future risk of TC-induced flooding. In addition, we will explore the potential influence of volcanic aerosols that penetrate the stratosphere on TC activity. Further, this study plans to examine the influence of changes in ocean circulation on TCs, which affects the probability of intense hurricane landfalls by altering the amount of ocean heat content available to TCs close to landfall.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Preliminary data indicate an active subsurface biosphere in samples of the lower oceanic crust collected from Atlantis Bank in the SW Indian Ocean as deep as 790 m below the seafloor. Even if life exists in only a fraction of the habitable volume where temperatures permit and fluid flow can deliver carbon and energy sources, an active lower oceanic crust biosphere would have implications for deep carbon budgets and yield insights into microbiota that may have existed on early Earth. This is all of great interest to other research disciplines, educators, and students alike. A K-12 education program will capitalize on groundwork laid by outreach collaborator, A. Martinez, a 7th grade teacher in Eagle Pass, TX, who sailed as outreach expert on Drilling Expedition 360. Martinez works at a Title 1 school with ~98% Hispanic and ~2% Native American students and a high number of English Language Learners and migrants. Annual school visits occur during which the project investigators present hands on-activities introducing students to microbiology, and talks on marine microbiology, the project, and how to pursue science related careers. In addition, monthly Skype meetings with students and PIs update them on project progress. Students travel to the University of Texas Marine Science Institute annually, where they get a campus tour and a 3-hour cruise on the R/V Katy, during which they learn about and help with different oceanographic sampling approaches. The project partially supports two graduate students, a Woods Hole undergraduate summer student, the participation of multiple Texas A+M undergraduate students, and 3 principal investigators at two institutions, including one early career researcher who has not previously received NSF support of his own. <br/><br/>Given the dearth of knowledge of the lower oceanic crust, this project is poised to transform our understanding of life in this vast environment. The project assesses metabolic functions within all three domains of life in this crustal biosphere, with a focus on nutrient cycling and evaluation of connections to other deep marine microbial habitats. The lower ocean crust represents a potentially vast biosphere whose microbial constituents and the biogeochemical cycles they mediate are likely linked to deep ocean processes through faulting and subsurface fluid flow. Atlantis Bank represents a tectonic window that exposes lower oceanic crust directly at the seafloor. This enables seafloor drilling and research on an environment that can transform our understanding of connections between the deep subseafloor biosphere and the rest of the ocean. Preliminary analysis of recovered rocks from Expedition 360 suggests the interaction of seawater with the lower oceanic crust creates varied geochemical conditions capable of supporting diverse microbial life by providing nutrients and chemical energy.  This project is the first interdisciplinary investigation of the microbiology of all 3 domains of life in basement samples that combines diversity and ""meta-omics"" analyses, analysis of nutrient addition experiments, high-throughput culturing and physiological analyses of isolates, including evaluation of their ability to utilize specific carbon sources, Raman spectroscopy, and lipid biomarker analyses. Comparative genomics are used to compare genes and pathways relevant to carbon cycling in these samples to data from published studies of other deep-sea environments. The collected samples present a rare and time-sensitive opportunity to gain detailed insights into microbial life, available carbon and energy sources for this life, and of dispersal of microbiota and connections in biogeochemical processes between the lower oceanic crust and the overlying aphotic water column."

Our proposal will measure organic carbon isotopes of microscopic fossils that represent our best window into the evolution of life before the rise of animals. These measurements will help us figure out where in the oceans early organisms were living and if early life could thrive in waters with little to no oxygen. This work will involve undergraduate students in every aspect of the research, analysis, and writing. We will create new geochemical and paleontological educational modules for K-12 and college educators, develop innovative organic geochemistry techniques that will be shared with the broader scientific community and add information on early fossil life to the open-access Paleobiology Database. <br/><br/>While we have learned a significant amount about the Proterozoic Earth system in the last few decades, major questions remain, especially about the interplay between biology and the rise of atmospheric oxygen. One window into the biological record of the Proterozoic is via organic carbon isotopes, which track the isotope systematics of fixed carbon. However, these measurements are almost always done on bulk samples that represent the entire biological community time averaged into a sedimentary sample, which limits our ability to use these measurements to reconstruct short-term carbon cycle dynamics and to probe the structure of ancient ecosystems. Recent advances in NanoEA-IRMS now allow us to reliably measure the carbon isotopic composition of a single organic microfossil and compare that value to the bulk 13C. We seek to use this new technique to explore how organic carbon isotopes can illuminate two persistent unknowns in the Proterozoic Earth-life system: 1) What were the habitats and metabolisms of early eukaryotes? and 2) What can single microfossil carbon isotopes reveal about the controls on bulk carbon isotopes in the Proterozoic stratigraphic record and what do these records tell us about the Proterozoic Earth system?. We will approach these questions by analyzing bulk, kerogen and fossil organic carbon samples from four richly fossiliferous units that span the history of Proterozoic eukaryotes. <br/><br/>The broader impacts of this proposal include continued development and refining of stable isotope analysis techniques, and integration of the Proterozoic microfossil record into the open-access Paleobiology Database. The proposal team will involve undergraduate students in all aspects of the research, and undergraduates will be meaningfully involved in data collection and interpretation. The team will also develop new educational activities for both high school and college-level audiences.

But not all.  Periods lasting hundreds of thousands or millions of years, for example during the Miocene and Pliocene, are loosely correlated with CO2 changes that are too small-- at least according to climate models-- to generate the large climate changes evidenced in proxy records.  The purpose of this study is to investigate Miocene and Pliocene climate, with an emphasis on understanding the mechanisms responsible for widespread warmth, reduced temperature gradients, and apparently high climate sensitivity.   Climate models have been unable previously to reproduce these features, raising concerns regarding their ability to correctly predict future warming.   This study is novel and significant because a multi-disciplinary team combining expertise in paleoclimate data, models, and theory will generate geographically widespread, multiproxy past climate records.  This data will be compared with new and advanced modeling approaches.  A benefit of this approach is that climate models will be improved by this comparison with past data and the lessons learned will lead eventually to improved predictions of future climate change.  <br/><br/>Specifically, although significant progress has been achieved in understanding of Miocene and Pliocene climates, explanations are lacking for some their basic elements, such as: weakened meridional temperature gradients, weakened zonal temperature gradients across the Pacific, and preferential warming in polar regions, in upwelling regions, and in continental interiors. This study's goals are to better quantify these enigmatic features by developing new geochemical records and compare this data with state-of-the art climate modeling that will enable better prediction of the Earth system to greenhouse gas and non-greenhouse gas forcing.  To accomplish this, the project will: (1) Enhance understanding of the signal being recorded by various paleoclimate proxies for sea surface temperature (SST) and generate a suite of new TEX86 and Uk37 paleo-SST records, complemented by existing records, to provide a comprehensive view of evolving surface ocean conditions from the mid Miocene through the Pliocene. (2) Conduct simulations of mid-Miocene and mid-Pliocene climate using the Community Earth System Model (CESM), with a new atmospheric component, CAM5, that includes more sophisticated treatment of cloud-aerosol interactions than previous models. Sensitivity studies to cloud microphysical properties and parameterization, including mixed-phase cloud properties and aerosol (sulfate and dust) emissions will be conducted to constrain previously unexplored interactions between cloud microphysics, aerosols and past climates. (3) Simulate Miocene and Pliocene climates using the ""Super-parameterized"" (SP) version of the CESM. SP-CESM incorporates a cloud-resolving model in each grid cell to represent convection and clouds more explicitly rather than parameterize them, allowing a more accurate representation of convection and cloud effects on the large-scale atmospheric circulation.  In addition to the research objectives, the project has education and engagement components.  It will fund two graduate students and a female early career research scientist in STEM disciplines.  Three public engagement efforts will be conducted, including public lectures, a website for a broad audience, and an afterschool program for high school students."

Faculty members, postdoctoral scholars, and graduate and undergraduate students from the Five Colleges Geology Consortium (Amherst College, Hampshire College, Mount Holyoke College, Smith College and UMass Amherst) will use this instrument to investigate diverse questions relating to Eart's history and environmental change. Two primary isotopes that will be measured are oxygen and deuterium, which are used to trace processes occurring within the water cycle. Measuring oxygen or deuterium isotopes in geological archives, such as speleothems or ocean sediments, provides a way of examining what Earth's water cycle was like during times in the past when atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2; an important greenhouse gas) levels were similar to today. By using isotopes to study the water cycle in the past, we gain important information on what future conditions on Earth will be like. The researchers will offer a short course on isotopes, which will be open to faculty, postdoctoral scholars, graduate students and undergraduates from nearby community colleges and state colleges, to reach new users and communicate scientific results to a wider audience; all participants will gain hands-on experience measuring isotopes with the new mass spectrometer.<br/><br/>This award allows for the purchase a ThermoElectron Delta V, equipped with a dual inlet, an IsoLink II, a Trace GC, and Conflow IV.  Three major research projects will be enabled by the new instrumentation: (1). The mid-Pliocene warm period (mPWP), from ~3.3 to 3.0 Ma, is a current priority of the international research community because it is the most recent interval in Earth's history with higher carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations than the pre-industrial Holocene. Carbon and hydrogen (deuterium) isotopes of leaf waxes preserved in marine and lacustrine sediments from key sites in the Arctic (Siberia) and tropics (Africa, Australia) provide information regarding past hydroclimate variability and vegetation response to past warm periods, including the mPWP and Pleistocene interglacials, with direct relevance to projections of future climate.  (2). The production of CO2 in upland soil environments profoundly shapes the fluxes of carbon from terrestrial streams to the ocean-atmosphere system. This occurs through both its modulation of (a) groundwater pCO2 and subsequent evasion rates to the atmosphere in stream headwaters, and (b) proton supplies to chemically weather bedrock and transport alkalinity. The quantitative description of these connections between soil respiration and stream carbon fluxes will help constrain terrestrial carbon budgets and provide frameworks for predicting the response of these fluxes to climate change in the future and through Earth history. (3). 80% of Madagascar's population lives in poverty and is almost entirely dependent on local, subsistence agriculture to survive. Understanding past rainfall variability may provide insight to how rainfall might vary in a warming world. Studies of changes in tropical hydrology in Madagascar from speleothem isotopes will provide important new data from the Southern Hemisphere tropics and thereby help establish the timing of changes in the Indian Monsoon in the Southern versus Northern Hemispheres on orbital and millennial timescales. They will also help determine what drives interannual rainfall variability. The researchers will offer an intensive short course during the winter session in January 2020 ""An Introduction to Carbon, Oxygen and Hydrogen Stable Isotopes: Application to Earth and Environmental Sciences"", which will be open to students (undergraduate and graduate), postdoctoral scholars and faculty from nearby state and community colleges. Students will learn about isotopic analysis of waters, carbonates, plant leaf waxes, CO2 and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). The workshop, and research opportunities available at UMass, will be advertised in part by delivering short presentations to relevant classes at nearby community colleges. Through these activities, the team hopes to attract a new and diverse group of users to the UMass Stable Isotope Laboratory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rather than the expected smooth response to the Moon's shadow, the electron and ion temperatures observed by two satellites traversing the topside ionosphere at 850 km in altitude showed complex and sporadic jumps between regions of cooler plasma and regions where the temperatures were nominal. This project will investigate these unexpected plasma temperature modulations by conducting a thorough analysis of the plasma observations (temperatures, density, flows) for this and other past eclipse events. This will provide important information about how the ionosphere responds to the transient changes in the illumination drivers. Knowledge of these responses is important since solar illumination is a key driver of fundamental processes of ionization and structuring. Radio propagation through the ionosphere depends on how much ionization and structuring occurs, and solar eclipses provide a controlled and quantifiable way to learn more about both positive and adverse effects of the ionosphere on global networks that use radio frequencies, for example the Global Navigation Satellite System. <br/><br/>This project will provide detailed characterization of the ionospheric plasma anomalies during solar eclipses using Defense Meteorological Satellite Program measurements of the plasma density, electron and ion temperatures, and plasma transport. It will also provide identification and characterization of mutual relationship between the irregular solar source regions and consequential ionospheric transient modulation. Finally, the project will identify the physical mechanisms, controlling parameters, and limiting cases of the anomalous flows and temperatures. The ultimate goal of this work is to obtain a better understanding of how short-term changes in the illumination of the dayside ionosphere can produce non-uniform responses in the ionospheric density, temperature, and drifts.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to the development of a highly-skilled workforce by supporting a graduate student at Boston University.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A large-aperture densely-sampled hydrophone array system can provide significant enhancement in marine mammal vocalization detection by increasing signal-to-noise ratio via coherent beamforming which eliminates noise outside of the signal beam.  Whale vocalizations not detected using a single hydrophone or sparse array can be extracted out of the noise floor by coherent beamforming with the large aperture hydrophone array system.  The coherent beamforming also provides high-resolution estimates of whale vocalization bearings which are required for finding the range of the whale from the array and localizing the marine mammal in geographic space.  In addition to the array hardware, the project also aims to develop a real-time array signal data acquisition, processing and analysis software to provide real-time detection, bearing-estimation, localization and tracking, and classification of marine mammal vocalizations received on the coherent hydrophone array hardware system.  The hardware and software systems together make up the passive ocean acoustic waveguide remote sensing (POAWRS) technology.<br/><br/>POAWRS is a transformative approach for ocean sensing, since it is capable of monitoring sound sources over instantaneous wide areas spanning 100 km or more in diameter.  In addition to marine mammal vocalizations, the other sound sources detected by POAWRS include biology such as sounds from fish and crustaceans; geophysical processes such as hurricanes and submarine volcanoes; and man-made activities such as ships and other ocean vehicles, seismic airgun and sparker for earthquake plate tectonic studies and oil exploration, as well as offshore piling. The instantaneous continental-shelf scale environmental monitoring capability and temporal-spatial dynamics of sound sources revealed by POAWRS makes it an important technology that could become an indispensable tool in field operations, such as large-scale marine ecological studies, fisheries stock assessments and management, compliance-based marine mammal monitoring mandated by the Marine Mammal Protection Act in seismic surveys and naval sonar surveillance operations, as well as in studies of the effects of man-made sound on marine ecosystems.  When combined with an active acoustic or seismic source, such as on the RV Langseth, the proposed instrumentation can be extended for large-scale imaging of objects and features in geophysical, fisheries, ecological and archeological surveys. The project provides an opportunity for training and development work to a diverse team that includes both women and under-represented minorities.  The principal investigator has and will continue to host and provide opportunities for K-12 students, undergraduates and teachers to learn and contribute to ocean exploration and discovery through Northeastern University's STEM Education Center, Research Experience for Teachers (RET), Young Scholars Program (YSP) and various undergraduate research opportunity programs.  They have and will continue to visit elementary, middle and high schools to provide demonstrations and hands-on training in ocean discovery and sensing through ocean sounds."

Results of this stratigraphic work will be compared to similar data collected from an ocean drilling core taken 2.2 kilometers away a number of years ago.  Broader impacts of the work include strong international collaboration with French, German, Italian, and Chinese scientists, support of a multi-national science program to understand the composition and magmatic section of the seafloor, and the training of two graduate students, one US and one Chinese, with the second being paid for by the Chinese government.

The growth of new faults presents a significant challenge for accurate assessments of earthquake hazards in seismically active regions of the world. Prediction of new fault growth would allow better understanding of the development of active fault systems. Through the accumulation of many earthquakes that each incrementally advance the fault system development, an initial distribution of 1 cm cracks can evolve into a 100-km long fault capable of damaging earthquakes. Because fault growth happens across a wide range of spatial scales and in the subsurface, geologists are unable to directly observe the growth of a new fault. This project uses a combination of physical laboratory experiments and computer models that simulate fault growth to explore this problem in the absence of direct observation. The computer models build on the idea that new faults grow to minimize work and achieve a lower energy state. The computer predictions, which will be compared with laboratory experiments, will simulate the development of new faults in front of an accretionary wedge, the Nankai trough south of Tokyo, Japan. This extremely well imaged subduction zone provides good constraints for testing the crustal fault growth models. The Nankai trough has produced several devastating earthquakes and insights learned from this subduction zone will guide our understanding of other subduction zones such as Cascadia margin off Seattle and the Aleutians in Alaska. Additional desired societal outcomes include full participation of women and persons with disabilities in STEM, development of a diverse competitive STEM workforce through graduate student and post-doctoral researcher training, international collaboration, and enhanced infrastructure for research by development and distribution of new computer modeling code.<br/><br/>Accretionary prisms are ideal locations for the study of fault development because the material incorporated at the toe of the prism is relatively un-faulted. Field observations suggest that through-going, prism-scale faults develop via the interaction and linkage of smaller fractures within accretionary systems. This coalescence results in the localization of strain along discrete faults from initially diffuse strain along many small fractures. This project examines the evolution of crack coalescence to fault formation within both scaled physical experiments and the Nankai prism. Accretionary systems will be modeled with an innovative new numerical code, GROW, which predicts fracture propagation through the optimization of external work. Crack coalescence will be simulated within four distinct systems: (1) biaxial and triaxial systems for validation with similarly loaded laboratory tests run at the University of Oslo, Norway, that use tomography to track crack coalescence;  (2) scaled physical experiments of accretion run at the University of Cergy-Pontoise, France, that provide known boundary conditions, material properties and detailed quantitative observations of the evolution of faulting and associated deformation; (3) accretion simulations of intermediate complexity and scale that provide a critical step between (2) and (4) and allow investigation of increasingly realistic parameters; and (4) simulation of the Kumano transect across the Nankai accretionary prism, which provides a well-constrained example of the development of in-sequence and out-of-sequence crustal thrusts. For the latter, the proposed megathrust development will be simulated over the past 2 Ma in several successive time intervals. All four suites of models will investigate fault development considering the premise that faults grow to optimize the total work on the system. Many of the models will initiate fault growth and coalescence from initial distributed seed points, that represent weak heterogeneities in the experiment and crust. For all suites of models, the evolving work budget within the systems reveals the competing influences of different deformation mechanisms. By investigating the relationship between strain localization, fracture interaction and various energy consuming processes within each system, the researchers will be able to compare the differences in these relationships between models of cm-scale, laboratory physical experiments and km-scale, natural orogens."

However, coastal communities are at risk from major storms, as highlighted by recent Hurricanes Irene (2011), Sandy (2012), Matthew (2016), Harvey (2017), Irma (2017), Maria (2017), Florence (2018), and Michael (2018). Coastal-storm-related economic losses have increased substantially, largely owing to increases in population and development in hazardous coastal areas. As the frequency of intense storms increases, communities, infrastructure, ecosystems, and habitat will be under increasing threat from storm impacts. Despite the importance of coastal regions, there are few field observations during large storms. Major storms develop rapidly, and reconnaissance teams must mobilize quickly to obtain pre-storm site characterization and to deploy instruments to collect valuable perishable measurements during the storm. The flexibility to form the broad, interdisciplinary science teams needed to address system hypotheses is not available through traditional NSF programs. The Nearshore Extreme Events Reconnaissance (NEER) Association established under this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) will enable coordination and deployment of multi-disciplinary researchers to collect perishable data needed to learn from storm-induced coastal disasters. The resulting observations will be useful to the science and engineering community to understand and predict the intertwined responses of the natural system, the built environment, and the socio-economic structures to impacts of extreme storms, leading to improved coastal management strategies and reduced risks. The NEER Association will entrain and train new members, including students and postdocs, ensuring a growing community of coastal-storm researchers.  <br/><br/>The national Nearshore Extreme Events Reconnaissance (NEER) Association will (i) build a network of academic, federal, and industry scientists and practitioners, (ii) coordinate and deploy interdisciplinary storm response teams, (iii) provide logistical support for field teams, and (iv) promote broad dissemination of the resulting data and findings. The NEER members will develop a database of potential field sites and emergency management contacts, and will entrain their local communities to determine key regional issues. When a storm is imminent, field team members will be selected to obtain data that will be used to address interdisciplinary questions relevant to the impacted region and the storm characteristics. These teams will conduct site characterization before and after extreme storms, and will collect measurements during storms that can be used to develop new concepts about the nearshore system. By working together across traditionally disparate disciplines, this community of academic, agency, and industry researchers will integrate diverse perspectives, methods, and goals, leading to development of new long-term collaborations and facilitating co-development of tools and integration of understanding of the nearshore system. The NEER Association will participate in the NSF-funded CONVERGE Leadership Corps and will coordinate with other NSF-supported Extreme Events Reconnaissance groups (EERs), including the Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering (ISEEER), Geotechnical and Structural Engineering (GEER and StEER, respectively), Operations and Systems Engineering (OSEER), and Social Science (SSEER) efforts. Instrumentation needs will be coordinated with the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) RAPID Facility, and communications and data dissemination will be facilitated in collaboration with the NHERI cyber-infrastructure DesignSafe-CI.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is important to investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying salinity tolerance in coastal bacterioplankton and their different responses to salinity in nature because (i) it will provide fundamental understanding for how microorganisms evolve to inhabit environments with different salinities, and (ii) alterations in coastal salinity are connected to climate change, so the way these alterations affect abundant coastal microorganisms also alters the biogeochemical cycling of, e.g., carbon. The project will examine microbial adaptations to salinity and determine how changes in salinity affect microbial metabolism using two closely related groups of abundant coastal bacterioplankton as model taxa. In addition, the research will continue and expand microbiology Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (mCUREs) in high-throughput cultivation and microbial characterization at the Lousiana State University. Sections of freshman biology laboratories will learn how to isolate, characterize, and molecularly identify microorganisms from local aquatic systems. mCURE sections will lead to newly isolated strains, genome sequences, and physiological data, these results will be published with the contributing students as co-authors. The relative success of mCURE sections will be assessed compared to traditional freshman biology sections. mCURE sections will offer unique opportunities for LSU students by creating excitement about research through discovery of new organisms and generating knowledge of the coastal habitats that are essential to the livelihood of the Gulf Coast.<br/><br/>The evolutionary transition between salt- and freshwater environments occurs rarely in microorganisms. In one of the most abundant aquatic groups, SAR11, the transition between salt- and freshwater environments has happened only once: all freshwater SAR11 belong to subclade IIIb/LD12, which has also been found to inhabit coastal environments where salinity varies widely. The first reported isolates of the SAR11 freshwater clade LD12 and a member of the sister clade IIIa from the same region are now available. These pure culture representatives provide a powerful model for experimentally investigating adaptations to new environments in microorganisms, specifically (i) the genomic pathway and regulatory distinctions that arise during the evolutionary transition from marine to freshwater environments, and (ii) the physiological mechanisms that underlie the ecological restrictions imposed on microorganisms by ionic strength in coastal and freshwater environments. Furthermore, because these organisms have distinct differences in metabolic potential, the isolates facilitate testing (iii) the effects of changing coastal salinity on microbial contributions to other biogeochemical cycles, such as that for carbon. The project will test the hypothesis that the relative ionic strength tolerances between the sister lineages (LD12, IIIa) result from fundamental differences in metabolic flexibility at a genomic and regulatory level. To do so it will assess transcriptional and metabolic responses to varied ionic strength for both taxa and measure the distribution and activity of both groups in nature to translate laboratory findings to the field. The research will provide new understanding of LD12 habitat range and insights into how the ""freshwater"" lineage evolved from a SAR11 common ancestor. The project will also more generally provide important information on microbial responses to salinity changes in coastal systems and the evolutionary paths separating freshwater and marine microorganisms.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by Biological Oceanography, Division of Ocean Sciences in the Directorate for Geosciences and by Systems and Synthetic Biology, Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences."

Quantifying this hazard is challenging in part because instrumental and historical datasets are too short to capture the extreme range of flood conditions possible at any particular location. Deposits from tsunamis and tropical cyclones, preserved within coastal sediments, provide a means to extend these records. However, there is significant uncertainty related to the movement of sediment during tsunamis and tropical cyclones, which hinders the interpretation of these event deposits. <br/><br/>To gain insight in sediment transport during tsunamis and tropical cyclones, computational modeling, informed by the properties of modern and paleo sedimentary deposits, will be performed. One assumption is that similarities exist in flow and transport processes between tsunamis and tropical cyclones; therefore, much can be learned from studying the two phenomena in tandem. Another assumption is that natural patterns exist in tsunami and tropical cyclone deposits such that correlations between deposit properties and their causative event can be obtained with advanced statistical methods coupled to computational modeling. The study will advance understanding of sediment transport during tsunamis and tropical cyclones and will improve the capability to predict the impact of future tsunami and tropical cyclones with more certainty, resulting in more resilient coastal planning, potentially saving lives and protecting livelihoods."

Water trapped between the plates is thought to play an important role in controlling friction along the plate boundary and may explain large variations in earthquake activity along the Alaska Peninsula. This study will collect seafloor electromagnetic geophysical data to image the distribution of water in the sediments and crust along the plate boundary, with the goal of understanding how the transport and release of water in this critical region may regulate earthquake behavior and plate slip. This project will advance electromagnetic imaging as a new tool for studying subduction zones, and one that will help to image fluid volumes in key areas of the megathrust fault. The project supports the training of undergraduate and graduate students at sea where they will learn how to collect and analyze marine electromagnetic data.<br/><br/>This project will use new marine electromagnetic (EM) imaging technology to study the fluid content of the crust and mantle along the Semidi and Shumagin sections of the Aleutian-Alaska subduction zone. These sections of the subduction system have markedly different seafloor fabric entering the subduction zone trench and commensurately different seismicity. Data from a 2011 active seismic survey at this location show variations in sediment thickness and crustal fracturing along the incoming plate but are not able to fully constrain the amount and distribution of fluid. Passive and active EM data will be collected during a month-long cruise at 160 ocean-bottom stations along three trench-crossing profiles and one along-strike profile. Controlled-source EM data will image the electrical conductivity of the sediments and crust, while passive magnetotelluric data will map deep crustal and upper mantle conductivity. Together these data will constrain the hydration state of the incoming plate at the trench outer-rise, the distribution of fluids along the plate-interface beneath the forearc, and the release of fluids into the overlying forearc crust. The new EM data will be interpreted in conjunction with the existing seismic survey results to: (1) test the hypothesis that along strike variations in seismicity and plate locking are related to the fluid content of the incoming oceanic plate, which in turn is related to the pre-existing fabric in the plate and the orientation of this fabric with respect to the trench; (2) image and quantify fluids released from sediment dehydration along the surface of the down-going plate; (3) image and quantify zones of over-pressurized fluids and hydrofacturing of the overriding plate related to fluid release from the slab; (4) compare the conductivity structure at the Aleutian-Alaska subduction zone with a similar profile at the Middle America Trench, an end-member system where seafloor faults are aligned parallel to the trench, potentially maximizing fluid-flux into the system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The OSNAP observing system consists of two legs: one extending from southern Labrador to the southwestern tip of Greenland across the mouth of the Labrador Sea (OSNAP West), and the second from the southeastern tip of Greenland to Scotland (OSNAP East). The observing system also includes subsurface floats (OSNAP Floats) in order to trace the pathways of overflow waters in the basin and to assess the connectivity of currents crossing the OSNAP line. The location of the OSNAP East and West legs purposefully melds with a number of long-term observational efforts in the North Atlantic: the Canadian repeat hydrography program in the Labrador Sea; the German Labrador Sea western boundary array at 53°N; the global Ocean Observatories Initiative node to be placed in the southwestern Irminger Sea; the repeat hydrographic sections across the Irminger and Iceland basins; and the Ellett line in the Rockall region. Substantial international collaboration has been garnered for OSNAP, including measurement contributions from the UK, Germany, the Netherlands and Canada. Importantly, this proposed observing system, in conjunction with the RAPID/MOCHA array at 26°N and the European Union NACLIM program at Nordic Seas overflows, will provide the first comprehensive three-dimensional measure of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and provide a means to evaluate inter-gyre connectivity in the North Atlantic. <br/><br/>This collaborative project will implement the OSNAP West  section and the OSNAP Float program. The primary observational components are: (i) a mooring array across the eastern margin of the Labrador Sea, where the subpolar boundary current enters the basin. This array will complement an analogous array across the western margin at the exit point of the Labrador Sea, maintained by institutions in Germany and Canada; (ii) a sequential release of acoustically tracked floats in the lower limb of the AMOC at the OSNAP East and OSNAP West boundary arrays. These floats will be seeded in the two densest components of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) over the four-year period of the measurement program (2014-2018).<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: For decades oceanographers have understood the AMOC to be highly susceptible to changes in the production of NADW. However, a number of recent observational and modeling studies have called into question this supposition, as more has been learned about the role of wind forcing in AMOC variability. Thus, the overall goal of this project is to establish an observing system that will determine the role that intermediate and deep water mass formation and basin-scale wind forcing play in the overturning and associated poleward heat transport, assessments that currently have only been theorized and modeled, but not observed.<br/><br/>Broader Impact: In January of 2007, the US Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology identified the study of the AMOC as one of four near-term priorities in the US Ocean Research Priorities Plan. This proposed work directly addresses that priority via a design of an AMOC observing system in the sub-polar North Atlantic. While a primary motivation for studying AMOC variability comes from its potential impact on the climate system, additional motivation for the measure of the heat, mass and freshwater fluxes in the sub-polar North Atlantic arises from their potential impact on marine biogeochemistry and the cryosphere. There is growing evidence that the ocean has played (and is playing) a role in the reduction of Arctic sea ice and in mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet - both of which have been attributed to changes in the poleward heat transport by the ocean. Also, the ocean plays an essential role in the carbon cycle by moderating increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO2 through the sequestration of anthropogenic carbon in the deep ocean. Variability in the AMOC is expected to impact this sequestration. Broader impacts also include the training of five graduate students in seagoing operations and in the processing and analysis of observational data. The graduate students will have an opportunity to collaborate with their international counterparts through virtual meetings and in-person visits and will be mentored by multiple advisors.<br/> <br/>This research award includes support for a Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) that is co-funded by NSF's Office of International and Integrative Activities."
