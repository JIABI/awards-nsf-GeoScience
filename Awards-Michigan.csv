The Magnetometer Array for Cusp and Cleft Studies (MACCS) is an NSF-funded ground-based array that records and disseminates important magnetic field measurements for scientific analyses. MACCS is the only longitudinally-spaced cusp-latitude array in existence and will continue to provide critical data for studies of geospace phenomena including solar wind-magnetosphere and magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions, the dynamics of the cusp/boundary layer/mantle/polar cap regions of the magnetosphere, geomagnetic storms and substorms, and localized instabilities that produce large geomagnetically induced currents which can cause power grid blackouts on Earth. Therefore, MACCS supports understanding and preparation for extreme space weather events which are a risk to national security. Additionally, this project supports the training of undergraduate and graduate student researchers<br/><br/>The project will continue operation of MACCS, an important magnetometer array that has been funded by NSF since 1991 and continue dissemination of the MACCS dataset to the scientific community. A new low-cost magneto-inductive magnetometer sensor will be deployed and tested at MACCS sites. Additionally, scientific studies will focus on: (1) performing detailed studies of high-latitude ULF waves, using multi-instrument ground-based and satellite data including MMS, the Van Allen Probes, and SWARM, (2) Continuing studies of nighttime impulsive magnetic perturbations relevant to geomagnetically induced currents, (3) combining GPS data and magnetic field data from MACCS and neighboring arrays to better understand the dynamics of the ionospheric projections of dayside and nightside boundary domains, (4) using machine learning techniques to study factors influencing relativistic electron fluxes, (5) producing higher-level data products characterizing global ULF waves and turbulence, and (6) carrying out theoretical studies and modeling studies using the Space Weather Modeling Framework of the excitation and propagation of ULF waves through the global magnetosphere-ionosphere system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite this, they are also among the most impaired ecosystems, necessitating improved understanding of the mechanisms that underpin their productivity. This project seeks to understand the key factors that drive ecosystem production in a degraded coastal ecosystem in Haiti using artificial reefs. Past research has shown that artificial reefs have substantial potential to increase the number and diversity of plants and animals, but the extent to which this can be achieved at scales relevant to society remains unknown. This project is constructing clusters of artificial reefs to test how (1) spatial arrangement and (2) fishing pressure (fished/not fished) influence the productivity of seagrass, coral, and fish over the course of four years. The fishing treatment is being implemented through collaborations with local fishers whereby small-scale no-take zones are created around three of the six artificial reef clusters. A unique aspect of the research is that it capitalizes on the experimental design to simultaneously achieve an important conservation initiative, while testing ecological theory. Community engagement and outreach are integrated directly into the research and local fishers are being surveyed to assess the extent to which fishing occurred on any of the artificial reefs. This research represents a novel effort to integrate experimentation with cutting-edge community-based conservation initiatives in one of the most impoverished regions of the world. The project is improving strategies for conservation and reef management.<br/><br/>Identifying the factors that regulate the structure and function of ecosystems is a fundamental challenge for ecological theory and applied science. This challenge is often framed within the context of Top-Down (TD) versus Bottom-Up (BU) regulation, but the extent to which this framework can predict processes in complex, real-world ecosystems is not fully understood. It is now widely recognized that TD/BU factors do not act in isolation. For example, in many ecosystems, consumers contribute to both TD (via consumption) and BU (via excretion) pathways. Environmental factors, including human-induced change, can further alter the nature of these interactions. Quantifying the strength of TD and BU pathways and the extent to which they regulate the structure and function in highly dynamic ecosystems requires an experimental system that is sufficiently tractable that all its components can be quantified, while still being representative of real ecosystems.  To address this challenge, this research project creates a unique ecosystem-scale artificial reef (AR) experiment in Haiti to test how two factors (AR structure, and fishing pressure) alter the strength of independent and interactive TD and BU pathways to regulate the structure and function of real-world reef ecosystems. Over the course of four years, the production of seagrass (surrounding the ARs), coral (transplanted onto the ARs), and fish (in and around the ARs) is being measured, providing a quantitative assessment of ecosystem-level production across the two treatments. Linear and structural equation models are used to measure the independent and interactive strengths TD and BU pathways, and to identify the suite of directional relationships between each trophic level that best predict overall ecosystem production. Harnessing the ability to use ecosystem-scale experiments and quantify production across all trophic levels in a highly complex, real-world system enables an unprecedented test of TD/BU theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed work will advance our understanding of the degradation of soil carbon exposed to oxygen or sunlight at Earth?s surface during land-surface disturbances. This knowledge will allow scientists to better predict the fate of C in arctic permafrost soils, and through an education and outreach plan, will allow society to better prepare for the potential acceleration of global warming through a positive feedback from the thawing Arctic. To engage underrepresented students in science, the PI proposes to expand the infrastructure of education through partnerships that will offer new opportunities to enhance teaching and communication skills. The PI will develop a curriculum in earth and environmental science integrated with her research, grounded in core education principles, and mapped to assessment goals. A novel contribution to curriculum development will be the combination of (1) education modules that ?telescope? in age-context and difficulty from K-12 to undergraduate to adult outreach levels, (2) data generation on student engagement and learning through micro-assessments of performance, and (3) enhanced active learning by iterative improvement of modules by students for their own peer groups. <br/><br/>This research will be done in the Alaskan Arctic because (1) the lakes, streams, and soil waters provide a natural experimental matrix of both high and low light, oxygen, DOM and Fe concentrations, and (2) there are tremendous stores of organic C in frozen soils (at least twice the amount of C now in the atmosphere) which are rapidly thawing from global warming. Using field surveys and experiments on natural waters to test mechanistic hypotheses, the PI will answer two main research questions: (1) Do reactions mediated by iron favor the complete oxidation of DOM to CO2 by sunlight and microbes? (2) Is the iron-mediated oxidation of DOM in the dark an important determinant of DOM fate?"

The amplification comes from thawing permafrost (frozen soils) that release greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide and methane, that lead to additional warming, more thaw, and more greenhouse gases released. However, how fast the permafrost will thaw, how much greenhouse gas will be released, and how important gradual thaw is versus abrupt thaw caused by melting ground ice or floods, is unknown. This Arctic Observing Network research will document changes in permafrost thaw, greenhouse gas releases, and energy balance in terrestrial and freshwater systems in the Alaskan and Russian Arctic. Arctic ecosystems have seen an acceleration of permafrost thaw and greenhouse gas release to the atmosphere that may not be easily reversed. Further observations are required to determine the rates of change and potential impacts on climate to best inform society on what to expect and how to prepare. In addition to advancing understanding of environmental change, broader impacts of the research include contributions to teaching, learning, and outreach by including findings in school classrooms, support of undergraduate summer research, and outreach to Indigenous communities and K-12 schools in Alaska. Two communities in the Alaskan and Russian Arctic will learn to map methane bubbling hotspots that create dangerous ice, which will result in co-production of knowledge and improved safety for winter travelers. Other benefits to society include improved understanding of how permafrost thaw threatens roads and buildings, and how a thawing Arctic influences climate change at lower latitudes.<br/><br/>This research will extend time-series data on carbon, water, and energy balance in four different tundra ecosystems in northern Alaska (year-round eddy covariance measured since 2007), and at two sites in Cherskii, Russia. The records already collected show evidence of recent change and tipping points, highlighting the value of supporting long-term measurements. In addition, carbon dioxide and methane fluxes measured by eddy covariance and ebullition will be monitored in a new thermokarst lake in Siberia, and ebullition will be measured on existing and new Alaskan and Siberian lakes mapped using remote sensing. Long-term monitoring of hydrology and stream chemistry of Imnavait Creek, Alaska, and depth of thaw in its catchment will be maintained and expanded. To help interpret these core data, the project will continue camera records of plant phenology and dates of snowmelt and snow return, harvests to assess plant biomass and net primary productivity, and analysis of soil properties and stocks of carbon and nitrogen. Permafrost boreholes will be instrumented near eddy covariance towers at Imnavait Creek and near the new lake in Cherskii. All data will continue to be made publicly available and archived with the Arctic Data Center, NSF-LTER Data Portal, and Ameriflux. Data collected by this project will be used extensively by other researchers and incorporated into other observing networks such as Ameriflux, the Phenocam Network, and other efforts including NASA projects and satellite campaigns.

Anticipating and managing future changes is a unique challenge requiring accurate representation and integration of climate drivers, biophysical responses, economic impacts, and adaptation decisions, but also the production of model outputs that are usable for decision making. To enhance usability, this project uses collaborations between scientists and stakeholders to foster mutual learning and the production of information that can support real-world decisions towards sustainability. In particular it focuses on advancing understanding of (1) the coupled human-natural system and (2) knowledge co-production, using harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the Great Lakes as a test case. As HAB events have been increasing globally over the past decade and directly impact ecosystem services for coastal communities (e.g., drinking water provision, fishing and recreation), understanding, predicting and alleviating this water quality issue is a problem of great societal relevance. The location of the study will be western Lake Erie because of the ability to build upon previous research and existing datasets and the team's previous involvement the region's policy networks. This integrated modeling approach is transferable and the results will be applicable to other coastal areas where stakeholders are attempting to manage complex ecological systems. The results will be communicated widely, leveraging the fact that  team members are actively engaged in regional and trans-national policy networks to purposefully disseminate the approach and lessons learned. The project will train a cohort of four graduate students and five postdoctoral fellows in an integrated interdisciplinary context.<br/><br/>The  work is organized around the overarching question: How does climate influence the biophysical dynamics of freshwater ecosystems and ecosystem services, and how can scientist and stakeholder co-production of information enhance coastal decision-making and sustainability? It will advance the fundamental knowledge of (1) the role of precipitation change and how uncertainty in climate model precipitation affects simulations of phosphorous loading, (2) the role of cold season processes on climate and phosphorous loading, (3) primary climate versus anthropogenic drivers that alter phosphorous loading, (4) the drivers over time and space controlling the size and location of future HABs, (5) how humans and the valuation of ecosystem services respond to HABs, and (6) information usability, by better understanding drivers of use and the kinds of decisions that may emerge from the co-production process. Four stakeholder sectors will be engaged: water treatment, beach management, recreational fishing and agricultural management and policy. Workshops will develop decision-relevant information for and feedback from those responsible for preventing future HABs (considering watershed loading simulations) and those required to adapt to current HABs (considering HAB forecasts)."

Due to these properties, constellations of 10s-100s of CubeSats with specialized instruments for studying the space environment provide a new exciting opportunity to understand and predict space weather.  The Space Weather Atmospheric Reconfigurable Multiscale Experiment (SWARM-EX) project provides an important step in the advancement of designing and building CubeSat constellations for space weather.  SWARM-EX will consist of three identical CubeSats with novel technologies for radio communications between satellites, onboard propulsion, advanced data downlinks, and autonomous operations within the constellation.  Each satellite will measure ionized and neutral gases in the Earth's upper atmosphere, studying structures seen near the equator.  The SWARM-EX mission uniquely fosters opportunities for STEM education and enables a platform for public outreach.  SWARM-EX will establish the first Intercollegiate CubeSat Mentoring Program - partnering institutions that have established CubeSat programs with new programs to create long-term, project-based learning environments across the nation.  Teaching, training, and learning will also be advanced through the inclusion of multiple graduate students, and undergraduate students from the six geographically distributed university programs involved in SWARM-EX.  This project resulted from the Ideas Lab: Cross-cutting Initiative in CubeSat Innovations, an interdisciplinary program supported by Geosciences, Engineering, and Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorates.<br/><br/>SWARM-EX is a bold step towards addressing outstanding aeronomy questions achieved through a global constellation of CubeSat swarms making in-situ ionospheric and thermospheric measurements between 300 and 600 km altitude.  The CubeSats in each swarm will range in separation from 1 to 1000 km and this separation will be controlled by a combination of differential drag and onboard propulsion. A pathfinder mission, supported by this project will use 3 identical CubeSats to demonstrate the SWARM-EX key technologies and address scientific questions related to the evolution of the equatorial ionization anomaly (EIA) and equatorial thermospheric anomaly (ETA).  The specific aeronomy questions are 1) How persistent and correlated are the plasma density and neutral oxygen in EIA and ETA features?; 2) Over what timescales, less than 90 minutes, do we observe changes in EIA/ETA properties due to non-migrating tides and geomagnetic activity?  These CubeSats will demonstrate novel technology including RF cross-links, propulsion, CDMA X-band data downlinks and on-board autonomy.  Additionally, each CubeSat will include an atomic oxygen sensor and Langmuir Probe thus making the measurements required to answer the proposed science questions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The remaining events, known as intermediate and deep earthquakes, take place over a depth range of 60 to 700 km and are focused within lithospheric oceanic slabs descending into the mantle at convergent plate boundaries. The distribution of these events has provided unique and direct evidence of mantle convection, the driving force behind plate tectonics that shapes the surface of the Earth. Though the information derived from deep earthquakes have been essential for understanding the Earth's dynamic system as a whole, the physical mechanisms causing these events are still a mystery. In contrast to their shallow counterparts, deep earthquakes occur at depths where high temperatures and pressures should inhibit seismic brittle failure. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain their occurrence, though differentiating between them has been difficult partly due to resolution limitations in both seismic velocity models, which are critical in constraining the geometry and internal physical properties of subducting slabs, and earthquake source models, which characterize the spatial and temporal evolution of source regions during seismic failure. The goal of this study is to improve seismic velocity structure and earthquake source imaging resolution in the Japan, Kuril, and Izu-Bonin regions, which host a significant number of deep earthquakes. The improved seismic images will clarify the spatial relationships between earthquake source properties and the internal structure of subducting slabs. These relationships will provide a new set of fundamental constraints for evaluating the viability of proposed deep earthquake source mechanisms. Through this project, undergraduate students will have opportunities to work on the proposed research activities, K-12 outreach events will be organized to encourage girls to pursue STEM field careers, and public lectures will be given on the work to adults who participate in lifelong learning programs. <br/><br/>It is still unclear where deep-focus earthquakes nucleate and propagate within a slab, and as a result, details of the Earth's dynamic inner workings in the lower half of the upper mantle are still missing. Addressing this issue critically depends on accurate high-resolution images of both the slab internal structure and deep-focus earthquake source properties. Previous seismic image resolution and accuracy at depths below 300 km were limited from sparse data coverage and theoretical approximations used in traditional seismic tomography. Classical ray-theory based tomography images indicate that deep-focus hypocenters coincide with the highest wavespeed anomalies within the slab, traditionally viewed as the slab's cold core, where phase transformational faulting, involving the breakdown of metastable olivine, is considered as a likely cause of deep-focus earthquakes. However, with an unprecedented seismic data set in East Asia aided by the advanced full waveform tomography technique, the new images of the Japan, Kuril, and Izu-Bonin slabs (EARA2014) show that deep-focus earthquakes consistently occur near the top of high wavespeed regions, possibly indicating that these events occur near the top of the subducting slab. This intriguing observation motivated this proposal to further explore and resolve the fine-scale wavespeed variations and earthquake source properties in these slabs using high frequency full waveform information. The central hypothesis of this project is that deep-focus earthquakes nucleate and propagate along the top of the slab, where oceanic crust and a hydrous serpentine layer are located, i.e. away from the slab's cold core. In order to test this hypothesis, the following three specific goals will be pursued: (1) obtain a slab structural model with improved spatial resolution from the existing model EARA2014 using higher frequency seismic waveforms; (2) relocate deep-focus hypocenters and image deep-focus earthquake rupture propagation with the aid of the new tomographic slab model; (3) establish spatial relationships between the slab internal structure and deep-focus earthquake locations and rupture properties. If the central hypothesis of this project is supported by the proposed work, then there will be a paradigm shift in terms of our understanding of the nature of deep-focus earthquakes, and consequently, mechanisms other than phase transformational faulting need to be considered.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, despite all the efforts devoted to investigating the SSW, two fundamental questions about this type of wind remain unanswered: (1) where does the SSW originate in the corona; and, (2) how do the coronal plasma properties determine the in-situ heavy ion composition of the SSW?  This 3-year SHINE project is aimed at characterizing the coronal origins of the SSW in order to answer these two important science questions.  The project team will study the SSW, utilizing two completely different techniques: in-situ measurements of local wind plasma properties, and remote-sensing spectral or imaging observations. When combined together, these two techniques can become a formidable tool that allows the investigators to fully exploit their potential to study the origin of the SSW.  This project will benefit the solar research community and serve important educational functions.  By using two completely different measurement techniques, this project will serve as a bridge between two different solar physics communities that have been working in parallel with limited interaction: the in-situ community and the remote sensing community, and will thus stimulate a new wave of cross collaborations.  The research will be carried out at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, where it will support undergraduate education through the University's UROP program and graduate education through collaboration with the graduate students in our department.  The project will also support a young female postdoc, thus helping her establish a career as a woman in STEM disciplines.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>This 3-year SHINE project is aimed at characterizing the origin of the solar wind.  In order to achieve this goal, the project team will utilize in-situ measurements from ACE/SWICS and SWEPAM, Ulysses/SWICS, SWOOPS and Wind/SWE and combine the analysis with remote-sensing data from SOHO/MDI, SDO/HMI and Hinode/SOT.  The in-situ solar wind observations will be classified based on their coronal origin types rather then their in-situ properties.  Back-tracking methods will be used to identify the corresponding source regions on the Sun.  The physical properties of the solar wind source regions will be determined using spectral line intensities.  This research project is directly relevant to the NSF's SHINE program, because it will provide important knowledge about the origin of the solar wind.  Such knowledge is critical for accurate modeling and prediction of the space weather conditions from the solar surface to the Earth and beyond."

The research lies on the interface of seismic data analysis, earthquake modeling, and fault zone geology, providing a unique opportunity to synergize various research facets and promote communication between different research communities.<br/><br/>The current understanding of earthquake source physics is limited by the lack of constraints on the spatial distribution of fault damage zones and their effects on seismicity and interseismic deformation. Previous fault zone studies have relied on near-fault seismic arrays to obtain a cross-sectional view at the array location. The project will image the along-strike variation of fault damage zones and characterize site effects using broadband seismic networks to investigate whether fault damage zones strongly affect seismicity patterns. The project will also improve the understanding of stress drop variation by considering the effects of fault zone waves on earthquake source spectra. Moreover, previous simulations of earthquakes in fault zones have modeled either single earthquakes using arbitrary stress conditions or earthquake cycles without dynamic waves. The project will model earthquakes and interseismic deformation by considering damage rheology and dynamic effects of the fault zone wavefield. The seismic observations and earthquake cycle simulations together will unveil how fault damage zones influence earthquake source processes and how earthquakes and interseismic deformation contribute to the formation of fault damage zones. Additionally, the project will involve graduate students to design and lead hands-on geophysical activities related to the research for Earth Camp, a UM outreach program that provides week-long experiences to educate underrepresented high school students. It will promote the communication between non-science majors and graduate students by introducing poster fairs in a first-year undergraduate seminar course, and strengthen the research skills of students by developing research projects in upper-level undergraduate and graduate courses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the time of this event, the Indian Subcontinent was in the midst of geographic and geological upheaval. As it migrated northward across the equator, it passed over a volcanic hot spot that breached the crust and led to massive outpouring of basalt lava onto the continent forming the Deccan Traps. The effects of these events on India's land biota remain poorly understood due to understudy of India's geological and paleontological record during this time. The goals of this project are to improve understanding of (1) the timing and nature of Deccan volcanism and (2) its biological effects in continental organisms. Improved understanding of the biotic response to major geographic and geologic changes in India will allow comparisons with the record in North America and will inform studies of the interchange of organisms that resulted from India's subsequent collision with Asia.<br/><br/>This project brings together expertise in paleontology and Deccan Trap volcanology, geophysics, geochronology, sedimentology and stratigraphy of Trap-associated deposits. Traditional geological and paleontological techniques will be employed, as well as state-of-the-art radioisotopic dating, chemical fingerprinting, and study of magnetism preserved in basalts that are associated with key fossil beds. Research conducted as part of this project will be incorporated into Immersive Virtual Field Trips (iVFTs), which are cyber-learning applications that allow teachers to virtually take students to scientifically significant but inaccessible environments. iVFTs use location-based high-resolution spherical content, 360° panoramic video, giga-pixel imagery, and unique viewpoints via unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) to develop interactive, content-rich, and learner-driven virtual field explorations, experienced online via HTML5."

Frozen water is present in the atmosphere -- in clouds -- where foreign particles such as mineral dust promote ice nucleation. Consequently, surface-assisted ice nucleation, i.e. heterogeneous ice nucleation, has a significant effect on cloud microphysics. This implies that it is important to accurately describe heterogeneous ice nucleation in order to be able to accurately model the weather and climate. Though theoretical and empirical descriptions have been developed, there is still no complete description of the requirements of the heterogeneous ice nucleation process, and no framework to know a priori if a given surface will be a good ice nucleating agent.<br/><br/>Through the synergistic experimental and simulation efforts, the foundation for molecular level understanding of heterogeneous ice nucleation will be built. The focus of this research will be to relate the effects of surface charge and lattice match to heterogeneous nucleation of ice with an emphasis on the free energy of formation and the nucleation rate. Straightforward molecular dynamics (MD) simulations will provide detailed insights into water behavior near mica surfaces and will be compared with experimental findings. In addition, the kinetics and thermodynamics of ice nucleation will be calculated from simulations. The research will provide the basis for building predictive models of heterogeneous ice nucleation that can be incorporated into larger scale models relevant to atmospheric chemistry and weather prediction.<br/><br/>The simulation tools developed and results of this research will provide the basis to answer several of the top 10 questions related to molecular behavior of frozen water as listed by Bartels-Rausch (Nature, 2013), which are essential for predicting the future of our planet. Phase transitions assisted by surfaces in aqueous systems are relevant to a wide variety of fields and processes including biological assemblies, surfactants, nanotoxicology, semiconductor industry, food industry and others. Also, the research presents several learning opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in different forms. The collaborative nature of this research and the exchange program between the two scientist groups will expose the students to a multitude of tools used to study challenging problems in atmospheric chemistry.<br/><br/>The simulations will be used to develop informative videos to be used as educational tools as well as for recruitment of students into science and engineering. User-friendly modules that enable students to perform some simple molecular simulations, which can be used as supplements for class lectures to illustrate concepts in thermodynamics, kinetics and materials will be developed. These will be available to the scientific community free-of-charge. The results from the research will be published in peer-reviewed journals and will be presented in various national and international meetings."

As a result, water can control whether an ecosystem releases carbon (a carbon source) or stores carbon (a carbon sink). Consequently, the movement of water plays a key role in global carbon cycling, but DOC is also an important control on water quality across the globe. Understanding how water affects the production and movement of DOC can improve society's ability to provide water for industrial, agricultural, and domestic uses. How and when DOC moves through different types of rivers and ecosystems, especially during floods, is a major knowledge gap in carbon cycling and water quality research. This project will conduct analyses of river DOC dynamics from geographically diverse areas. The project will examine movement of DOC into and out of watersheds and evaluate if DOC dynamics can be estimated from local to continental regions using river flow and watershed properties. This DOC research is combined with an innovative education plan that will improve the translation of hydrological sciences to public audiences via undergraduate curriculum development and student-led scientific outreach. These advances will focus on training students to be effective science communicators and outreach practitioners.<br/><br/>Given the global importance of riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and uncertainty in the light of climate and land use change, the main objectives of this proposal are to test assumptions of watershed DOC flux behavior and to develop new ways to quantify and forecast DOC flux across understudied flow regimes and ecoregions. These objectives will be addressed through multiple approaches, including data synthesis, modeling, and new sensor technologies that will identify the key watershed and climate conditions controlling DOC flux across diverse landscapes. The project integrates these research objectives and general hydrologic science issues with a long-term education plan to establish innovative curriculum development and methods for creating effective outreach materials for multiple public stakeholder groups, including K-12, life-learners, and policy makers. The new curriculum employs novel human-centered design theory and partnerships with five expert outreach institutions to create meaningful experiential learning opportunities that are underrepresented in most science curricula.

It is however less recognized that sea level rise can push water tables above the land surface to flood low-lying depressions. Lakes and wetlands that form by groundwater flooding expose connected aquifers to direct, continuous evaporation, which can result in substantial losses of water resources. Impacts from groundwater flooding and evaporation will be most intense on low-lying carbonate islands, where evaporated freshwater is replaced by seawater that percolates through the bedrock. These models incorporate impact of climate and predicted that lakes should remain fresh, and groundwater resources continuous, beneath islands in humid regions. In arid regions, lakes would be hypersaline, and much fresh groundwater would be replaced by seawater. In contrast to expectations, modern lakes that are formed by groundwater flooding in the arid southern Bahamas islands have salinities that range from fresh to hypersaline. This paradox between modeled and observed lake salinity underscores our lack of understanding of how groundwater flooding impacts island water resources. During this project, new field data will be collected, and new transient modeling tools will be developed, to test the overarching hypothesis that how groundwater flooding will impact island water resources. We will test the impact of lake area relative to its groundwater contributing area, the degree of connectivity between lakes and the ocean, and dynamic interactions with climate and sea level change on this process. The results of this study should improve predictions of freshwater resource loss of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) from groundwater flooding, perhaps the primary environmental factor triggering their loss of habitability. The modeling tools to be developed as part of this project will be freely distributed to the hydrological community. A field hydrogeology curricular exercise, with learning outcomes of quantitative coastal hydrology, will be developed to be used by the more than 100 student groups that visit the Gerace Research Centre (base of operation for this project) each year. Project results will be presented as part of a guest lecturer series at the University of the Bahamas and at international conferences. The project will enhance human resources by introducing coastal hydrology to 2 geology PhD students, and one civil engineering postdoctoral researcher at Michigan Tech. Each PI will work with their institution's diversity office to ensure that these positions are effectively advertised to under-represented groups.<br/><br/><br/>Evaporation of lakes and wetlands that form on islands by groundwater inundation reorganizes groundwater flow paths and lowers water tables. Impacts from groundwater inundation and evaporation will be most intense on low-lying carbonate islands, where the Ghyben-Herzberg relationship results in losses from freshwater lenses (the primary freshwater resource) being 40x the lowering of the water table. Primary controls on groundwater inundation will be sea-level rise and island topography, but impacts to freshwater resources could be moderated by climate (precipitation, and evaporation), aquifer permeability, ratio of groundwater contributing area to lake surface area, and distance between the lake and coast. During this project, new field data will be collected, and new transient modeling tools will be developed, to test the overarching hypothesis that groundwater inundation will reduce freshwater lens volumes through interactions of lake area relative to its groundwater contributing area, degree of connectivity between lakes and ocean, and dynamic interactions with climate and sea level change. Hypothesis testing will take a three-pronged approach. First, DEMs of San Salvador Island, Bahamas, will characterize lake hydrogeological setting (catchment/lake area ratios). Field observations of hydrogeological parameters and weather data will be used to estimate groundwater fluxes and lake evaporation; chemical and isotopic compositions of groundwater, lake water, and precipitation will be used to estimate recharge thresholds and lake water sources (ocean, groundwater, recharged precipitation). Second, a package for simulating dynamic flow and solute transport between lakes and groundwater will be developed and integrated into the SEAWAT/MODFLOW model in cllaboration with USGS. The model will be parameterized with observational data collected on San Salvador Island. Third, transient responses of island freshwater lenses to multiple sea level rise, climate change, and lake formation scenarios will be tested with the newly developed numerical modeling tool. Simulations will determine the nature of relationships between freshwater lens volumes and sea level, climatic variables, and island-lake hydrogeological settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Finding energy and mineral resources, protecting water quality, preparing for the impacts of a changing climate, and keeping citizens safe from hazards such as floods and earthquakes are essential to the nation?s quality of life. In order for young people to choose career paths in Earth Science, they need well-prepared teachers who reflect the ethnic, racial, and gender diversity of our nation. These teachers should be able to effectively convey both the important concepts in Earth Science, and how Earth scientists gather and interpret information. Our project tests the idea that the best way to engage children in the knowledge and practices of geoscientists is for their teachers to have direct experience with scientific research. <br/>This project will create a 10-week summer program in which 8 undergraduate students per year gain direct experience in conducting scientific research and in translating this research experience into classroom lessons. Students majoring in science or in K-12 education from Western Michigan University, Lake Michigan College, and Kalamazoo Valley Community College will gain experience in four interwoven components: (1) Learn Science ? a two-week introduction to surface water quality and lake systems, (2) Practice Science ? a six-week water quality investigation in a local urban lake, (3) Teach Science ? two weeks of teaching preparation and practice with master teachers, followed by two weeks of supervised teaching in a middle school summer camp, and (4) Think Science ?  ten weeks concurrent with other program components in which students learn about how Earth Science is practiced by scientists and how they might best teach these practices to children.<br/>The ultimate goal of this project is to better prepare a diverse future Earth Science workforce. We expect that participating undergraduates will go on to impact thousands of K-12 students during their teaching careers, contributing to the nation?s scientific literacy and inspiring some of these children to become Earth scientists.  Additionally, this project explicitly recruits students of color and women from all participating institutions as a means for increasing the diversity of the Earth Science education workforce.  Finally, if this project is highly effective in preparing future teachers, we intend to advocate for this model to be adopted across our university and across the country.  <br/><br/>PART 2<br/>As states in the U.S. adopt the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), or adopt NGSS-inspired state standards, Earth Science takes a more prominent role across K-12 grades. Diverse and well-prepared teachers become ever more critical to expanding participation in the geoscience workforce. The best way to engage children in the knowledge and practices of geoscientists is for teachers to self-identify as geoscientists, which can be achieved through authentic experiences with scientific practices such as asking questions, gathering and analyzing data, and justifying claims with evidence. <br/>This project will create a 10-week summer program in which elementary and secondary science education undergraduates from Western Michigan University and two regional community colleges gain direct experience in conducting scientific research and in translating this research into classroom lessons while being guided through reflection of the work. Cohorts of 8 students per year will gain experience in four interwoven components: (1) Learn Science ? a two-week introduction to surface water hydrogeology and lake systems, (2) Practice Science ? a six-week water quality investigation in a local urban lake, (3) Teach Science ? two weeks of mentored  teaching preparation and practice followed by a two-week mentored teaching experience as summer camp instructors, and (4) Think Science ?  ten weeks concurrent with other program components in which students learn about the nature of science and scientific inquiry, reflect on their research experiences, design lessons to be taught at the summer camp, and reflect on their teaching experience. <br/>Because authentic research, teaching, and reflection on Earth Science research and education will be coupled, the outcome of this program will be that elementary and secondary science teachers will self-identify as geoscientists just as strongly as they do as teachers. Through this integrated approach, we will improve future teachers? knowledge of content, skills, and scientific practices in surface water hydrogeology and geochemistry, improve their ability to design and carry out a field- and laboratory-based investigation, increase their understanding of the context of the scientific method, improve their skill in designing and teaching lessons to middle school students, and improve their knowledge of classroom practices of science and how to use these to inspire more young people into careers in earth and environmental science. Ongoing external evaluation will provide data informing the project team as to whether we are meeting program goals, and where the program may be improved. <br/>As they go on to a career in teaching K-12 science, each of the 24 undergraduate students expected to participate in this program will collectively impact thousands of children. By self-identifying as a scientist and displaying comfort with scientific thinking and experimentation, they will be able to make their own students more comfortable with science and hence increase the chances that they will consider scientific career paths thus enabling our program graduates to inspire future geoscientists. Discussion of careers in the geosciences and related fields will be an explicit part of this program. Additionally, this project explicitly recruits students of color and women from all participating institutions as a means for increasing the diversity of the Earth Science education workforce.  We anticipate that this program will also impact other pre-service teachers through interactions with peers. Finally, we will disseminate our program model and best practices as identified through evaluation so that key aspects can be adopted at other teacher preparation institutions."

As such, it is possible to remotely characterize these hazardous mud flows by tracking their flow positions and energetics through time.  This work seeks to develop infrasound analytical tools to locate where lahars initiate, how far and fast they move, and estimate their mass flow. Toward these goals the project will deploy and maintain seismic and infrasonic instruments at Fuego Volcano (Guatemala), where lahars are common during the rainy season (April through September).  Rain gauges and time lapse cameras will be installed at locations along the lahar paths to understand how lahars initiate and to validate flow characteristics through direct observation. Fuego volcano is an ideal candidate for this study because of its frequent lahars and relatively easy access and because information learned will be applicable for mitigating risks.  Lessons learned at Fuego may then be applied to dozens of volcanoes in the US and around the world where lahar activity is common.  The project aims to train several graduate and undergraduate students from the US and result in scientific publication. Important capacity building in Guatemala will result from the training of Guatemalan scientists and technology transfer to observatory staff. <br/><br/>This project will improve our understanding of the seismo-acoustic source mechanisms associated with lahars, and to develop methods that can be used to track such sources and other rapid gravity-driven mass movements.  Through multi-parametric observations this study will contribute to our fundamental understanding of how lahars are triggered during precipitation events and where material is incorporated along the lahar flow path.  Infra-acoustic arrays and broadband seismic sensors will be deployed at Fuego Volcano (Guatemala) with the intent to remotely monitor the most frequent channels that carry lahars during the rainy season.  Signal processing techniques using data from an integrated network of arrays will be used to track and quantify flow energetics.  Fuego provides an ideal field site where seismo-acoustic data will be combined with contemporaneous rainfall and geomorphologic (terrain and channel slope) observations.  Computer vision techniques will be used to quantify timing, mass flow, and velocities of lahars at various positions along channels.  This work merges geomorphology and geophysical approaches to study hazardous lahar phenomena.  Broader impacts include development of applied technology for hazard mitigation and training of both US-based and Guatemala-based students and professionals. <br/><br/>This award is cofunded by the PredicMon of and Resilience against Extreme Events (PREEVENTS) program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cyanobacteria are microorganisms that were responsible for oxygenating the atmosphere by producing O2 via photosynthesis, thus enabling life as it is exists today. However, the specific factors that drove the rise of oxygen in the atmosphere are unknown. In particular, little is known about the controls on cyanobacterial O2 production under the low-O2, sulfide-rich conditions that were widespread during Earth?s progressive oxygenation. This project will study the interplay between, light, hydrogen sulfide, O2 production, and microbiology in modern cyanobacterial mats that thrive under conditions that mimic those of the early Earth. The research and results will be integrated into efforts to recruit, support, and retain underrepresented students in the geosciences in an effort aimed at diversifying the workforce. In order to disseminate lessons learned, results of this outreach effort will be shared with the public through the visitor center at the Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary, presented at conferences and published in an education journal. Finally, this interdisciplinary project will establish a close international scientific collaboration between the U.S. and Germany.<br/> <br/>This project will investigate geobiological controls on oxygen (O2) production by cyanobacterial mats under low-O2 and sulfidic conditions. Three central questions will be addressed to reveal the coupled microbial and geochemical processes. First, how do light and sulfide and their interactions control the balance of oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis? Second, how are the observed shifts in these photosynthetic modes underpinned by metabolic pathways and activity of different cyanobacterial populations? Third, how do these photosynthetic modes affect the rate of sulfide production, which could represent a feedback on the balance of oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis? The overall goal of the integrated approach behind addressing these questions is to reveal specific microbial populations, metabolic pathways, and geochemical processes that underpin mat biogeochemistry. Controlled experiments in mesocosms will be used to track rates of oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis as a function of light, sulfide, and mat structure over a diel cycle. In parallel, state-of-the-art ""omics"" approaches will provide an unprecedented view of the dynamics of metabolic pathways in these microbial communities at the level of DNA, RNA, and protein. The same experimental framework will be used to measure the metabolic activity of sulfate reducing bacteria under oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis across the diel cycle. These ex situ experiments will be rooted in reality via field investigations and direct measurements of mats in situ for parallel microprofiling of changes in geochemical parameters, assessment of metabolic processes, and proteomic analyses. More broadly, this project will advance the understanding of microbial geochemistry by forming an interdisciplinary team with diverse expertise to link geochemical processes to microbial populations and metabolic pathways with unprecedented resolution at the level of DNA, RNA, and protein."

The focus of the research is on the fundamental physics that governs the interactions, with specific applications to the California Current System. The California Current System is an eddy-rich eastern boundary upwelling region where energetic near inertial waves (NIWs) and tidal IWs (internal tides) have been previously observed and that will likely be used for NASA's Surface Water & Ocean Topography (SWOT) calibration and validation experiment. The approach will be to conduct a hierarchy of idealized and realistic state of the art numerical simulations in conjecture with in situ mooring observations for testing the realism of the models. The analysis will be based on numerical experiments of variable resolutions that systematically include and exclude tides and wind-forced NIWs. The PIs will engage in standard avenues for scientific communication, namely papers, seminars and presentations at society meetings. In addition, the proposed work will promote the career development of an early career scientist and support one postdoc, one PhD student and one MS student. The project will also support two summers of undergraduate research and the travel to the Coastal Ocean Environment Summer School in Ghana (coessing.org). This school, founded by one of the project team members, provides an opportunity for students from African countries to learn about oceanography.<br/><br/>The general circulation of the ocean is strongly constrained by the pathways that kinetic and available potential energy take from the basin-scale forces that inject them to centimeter scales, where they are depleted. To determine the ocean's response to future climate scenarios, these energetic pathways, from forcing to dissipation, must be understood and quantified. Previous studies have established the importance of mesoscale and submesoscale circulations to the kinetic energy route to dissipation, and of near-inertial and tidal IWs to the available-potential energy route to mixing, but a comprehensive study of the coupling between the two routes and the role of the eddy-wave interactions has not been carried out. Here the realistic simulations together with idealized simulations that will methodically investigate the interactions under variable stratification, rotation, and forcing magnitudes, will greatly advance the understanding of present and future oceanic energy distributions. The work will advance current understanding of ocean energetics, and will guide the development of diffusive parameterizations that take into account the combined spatiotermporal contributions of the different phenomena to energy mixing and dissipation. These parameterizations can be implemented in climate models and improve climate projections. In addition, this work will greatly ameliorate the interpretability of present and future satellite sea-surface height observations, whose analysis will be complicated by incoherent internal wave signals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, and integrates the co-production of knowledge. This award fulfills part of that aim.<br/><br/>The cold and dark wintertime conditions of the Arctic lead to frequent poor air quality episodes linked to local emissions along with temperature inversions that trap pollutants in the areas where people live. Infrastructure planning such as energy generation and industrial activities along with residential choices of heating fuels such as wood, fuel oil or others are critical aspects of this problem. Residents spend the majority of their time indoors during wintertime, so most exposure to pollutants occurs indoors. From this background, fundamental knowledge gaps were identified in: outdoor/indoor air transport, indoor pollution sources such as leaky heating appliances, and chemical transformation of pollutants under these Arctic conditions.  These gaps must be closed to understand the impacts of air pollution on Arctic communities and improve community health. Sustainably Navigating Arctic Pollution -- Through Engaging Communities (SNAP-TEC) focuses on improving understanding of wintertime Arctic outdoor and indoor air pollution. Discussions with community members will assist researchers in identifying local concerns regarding air quality and in designing appropriate sustainable development frameworks with the goal of improving air quality for Arctic peoples. <br/><br/>To investigate wintertime Arctic air pollution issues at the intersection of the natural and built environments and social systems, SNAP-TEC uses a convergence approach that starts with a community engagement process to build a research and co-generation of knowledge program that has direct impacts on the community. This project has grown out of organizing efforts under the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Project activity ""air Pollution in the Arctic: Climate, Environment and Societies"" (PACES) and the Alaskan Layered Pollution and Chemical Analysis (ALPACA) project, which have documented knowledge gaps in this area (see the ALPACA whitepaper, readily available online).  SNAP-TEC brings together a multi-disciplinary team to investigate this problem, with the center focus being a wintertime field campaign in Fairbanks, Alaska, where the scientific and social issues surrounding poor air quality can serve as a case study to inform practice and policy in similar cities and villages across the broader Arctic region. The resulting knowledge of pollution sources and chemistry, housing and pollution control technology, and social aspects can assist New Arctic communities to plan appropriate solutions that work for residents. Local and Indigenous peoples are most likely to be affected by Arctic development, so our community engagement process will include local Fairbanks residents and Alaska Native community members. The project measures indoor and outdoor air quality using state-of-the art instrumentation to advance fundamental understanding of air pollution sources and chemical processes under cold and dark conditions, indoor/outdoor air exchange and physicochemical changes to pollutants upon warming to indoor conditions, sulfur oxidation chemistry, and toxicity of air pollution. The field program is combined with community meetings, public participation in scientific data collection (a.k.a. citizen science, using inexpensive air-quality sensor monitoring) and a survey to assess public understanding of air quality, trust in science, perceived risk and uncertainty, and support for air quality policies. The SNAP-TEC research team involves a diverse group of natural and social scientists and engineers with extensive student involvement to address the problem. Through the international PACES organization, lessons learned from this investigation will be extended to an international pan-Arctic context through identification of fundamental processes and best practices, informing Arctic development and future studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These metals are vital components of our nation's civil and military infrastructure, and understanding how these ore deposits form is fundamental to ensuring a sustainable supply for our growing population. Observations of natural volcano-related ore systems indicate that the element sulfur is almost always associated with copper, gold and iron, which suggests that sulfur may play a role in concentrating these metals to levels that allow companies to mine them profitably. In nature, sulfur exists in several different states, depending on how much oxygen is present, and scientists have determined that the state of sulfur moderates the mobility of copper, gold and iron in volcanic systems. In this project, the scientists are investigating how to use sulfur concentrations in the mineral apatite, which is the same mineral that makes human teeth and bones, as a way to better constrain the formation of metal deposits and understand more broadly what controls the movement of sulfur in volcanic systems. The science team includes university faculty, a post-doctoral researcher, one doctoral student who is the first in his family to graduate from college, and several undergraduate students who will work closely with the senior scientists. The scientists are collaborating with faculty and students at the University of Hannover, Germany, where they will learn new techniques and then implement them at the University of Michigan.<br/><br/>This project has as a main goal to provide critical information to constrain Earth's sulfur cycle. Scientists have determined that sulfur in the oceanic crust and overlying sediments is recycled to the upper mantle at subduction zones and partly returned to the surface via arc volcanism.  Existing data demonstrate that the sulfur isotope signature of oceanic crust differs significantly from that of volcanic gases and arc magmas. Arc magmas typically have low sulfur contents, but cover a wide range of sulfur-34/sulfur-32 isotope values from -0.5 to +20.7 per mil, whereas oceanic crust is typically more sulfur-enriched and characterized by average sulfur-34/sulfur-32 values that are close to 0 per mil. Working hypotheses to explain these discrepancies include degassing, metasomatism, and variations in oxidation state. In this study, we are working to test whether or not the total sulfur content and the sulfur isotopes abundances in apatite crystals and coexisting silicate melt can help elucidate Earth's sulfur cycle. A prerequisite for the interpretation of total sulfur and sulfur isotope signatures in apatite and application of this to understanding processes affecting volatiles in subduction zone magmas is a quantitative knowledge of the sulfur speciation in apatite over a wide range of oxidation states. We are investigating experimentally total sulfur and sulfur isotope partitioning between apatite and silicate melt at conditions relevant to subduction zone volcanic environments. The proposed approach combines equilibrium fractionation and dynamic decompression experiments with high precisions sulfur and sulfur isotope analyses. They plan to use micro-Xray absorption near edge spectroscopy to determine the oxidation state of sulfur within single apatite crystals and the coexisting melt phase. The experiments will yield a robust and comprehensive dataset, which will facilitate the interpretation of total sulfur and sulfur isotope signatures in apatites and coexisting silicate melt in natural systems. Simultaneous with the experimental program, we are measuring total sulfur and sulfur isotope abundances among samples from active volcanoes (Mt. Mazama, Mt. Pinatubo, Mt. Merapi, and Quizapu). Assuming that apatites can preserve the S (isotope and speciation) signal of a magma formed due to dehydration melting above the subducted slab, our experimental data may enable the estimation of the S (isotopic) composition of the involved fluids derived from the slab, determine the redox of a magma at apatite formation and elucidate the degassing history of a magma, all based on the analyses of natural samples."

Students will present their research results at an end of summer symposium, and will receive financial support to attend and present their work at a professional conference following the completion of the summer program. <br/><br/>This REU site will seek to engage students from groups typically underrepresented in STEM disciplines in research from a broad range of atmospheric and space science disciplines, including climate science and adaptation planning, atmosphere-biosphere interactions, aerosols and atmospheric chemistry, air quality, space-based remote sensing, space-weather and planetary atmospheres. Improvements in our understanding of the atmospheric and space sciences rely on the use of both ground- and space-based observations.  In addition to providing insights into many complex environmental processes and trends, these observations can also be used to evaluate the performance of regional/global climate models, ecosystem-level models, and space weather models, each of which represent our best theoretical descriptions of these processes.  These observations and models are used to protect human health and welfare in a number of ways, ranging from aiding in the development of adaptation strategies to protect community infrastructure in a changing climate, to allowing for the prediction of the timing and intensity of solar storm interactions with our atmosphere, which have the potential to impact communications and our nation's power grid.  Through the introduction of the students to topics such as measurement design, quality assurance and control, data analysis and presentation, model development and evaluation, and assessment and communication of scientific uncertainties, this project will seek to produce scientifically and ethically responsible future scientists, while improving the overall self-efficacy of these students regarding their continued participation in STEM fields."

The importance of real-time scientific data (data that are used as soon as they are collected) is ever increasing, particularly in mission critical scenarios, where informed decisions must be made rapidly. Many of the phenomenon occurring within the geosciences can benefit from better coverage of real-time data. Geosciences phenomenon range from hurricanes and severe weather, to earthquakes, volcano eruptions and floods and real-time data are essential to understand these phenomena and predict their impacts. The National Science Foundation funds many small teams of researchers that reside at Universities whose measurements can be of benefit to a better understanding of these phenomenon in order to ultimately improve forecasts and predictions. This is where Cloud-Hosted Real-time Data Services for the Geosciences, or CHORDS, fits in.<br/><br/>CHORDS makes it simple for small research teams to make their real-time data available to the research community in standard formats. By following a few simple steps, a CHORDS ?portal? can be created for a research team and their data can be streamed into it very easily. CHORDS can also be used to access data from large NSF research platforms like radars, aircraft, ships and operational networks of sophisticated instrumentation. Once these data are ingested by a CHORDS portal, they are exposed in standard formats and are available to complex scientific tools such as prediction models and other analysis or decision-support systems. Since the CHORDS concept will be exposed to small research teams at Universities, this will allow college students to learn about the importance of real-time data and how to incorporate these data into their analysis. By having more and higher quality measurements available thorough CHORDS, models and other tools can make more accurate forecasts and provide better-informed decisions to mitigate the impacts and improve the understanding of these phenomenon."

This challenge arises in part due to the central role that clouds and precipitation processes play in the tropical circulation. While there is much that remains to be learned about the processes that drive tropical rainfall, numerous advancements have been made in recent decades. For example, research has found that the concentration of water vapor in the atmosphere plays a central role in the regulation of tropical rainfall. In spite of this breakthrough, our understanding of how water vapor, precipitation and large-scale atmospheric motions in the tropics occur remains limited. This study seeks to understand such interactions on perturbations in the atmospheric flow that are known as tropical disturbances. These include disturbances whose horizontal flow is largely rotational such as easterly waves, equatorial Rossby waves and monsoon low-pressure systems. These systems play an important role in the hydrologic cycle of multiple regions in the tropics, such as the Caribbean, and often develop into tropical cyclones, and have far-reaching impacts in the extratropics. <br/><br/>The research will provide important insights on the organization of precipitation in the tropics, which will lead to improvements in the representation of these processes in models.  Furthermore, because these disturbances sometimes develop into tropical cyclones, insights provided by this study may be of interest to the forecasting of tropical cyclogenesis. Results from the project have great potential to form a new general theoretical framework for tropical motions, which may be included in a course in tropical meteorology. A graduate student and a postdoc will be supported through this award. The knowledge gained from the research project will also be used for public outreach and general education.  <br/><br/>Novel statistical techniques will be used to analyze the interactions among water vapor, precipitation and circulation. The team will examine observational data and simulations from numerical models to obtain a lucid, clear picture of how circulations in these ""rotational tropical disturbances"" modulate the distribution of water vapor and precipitation processes. The study will elucidate the ways in which water vapor modifies precipitation, and how this change in rainfall affects circulations of these disturbances. The role that thermodynamic processes such as radiation and condensation play in this interplay will also be examined.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The US research community must currently work with colleagues in Europe to gain access to a large cloud chamber facility.  The workshop will investigate whether a US-based large chamber facility would be a significant benefit to the scientific community and, if so, what that chamber should look like.  The main societal impact of this workshop will be future-looking, as an eventual cloud-aerosol chamber would provide a national resource to help improve weather and climate modeling.<br/><br/>The meeting will take place in Boulder, Colorado in late 2019.  The main objective of the workshop will be to gauge community interest and to obtain a sense of priorities for the various scientific challenges that are likely to be amenable to laboratory investigation.  The organizers note that the need for a cloud chamber with path lengths over 10m and a total volume over 100m3 has been previously described in agency documents and in community discussions.  This workshop will address questions about what can be learned in such a chamber that can't otherwise be studied, and what kind of measurement capabilities it should have.

The results of this work will provide an opportunity to use the past to understand the present response of mammalian and plant communities to rapid warming events in the long term, information that is critical for the management of habitat resources. Additional broader impacts of this study include the development of scientific expertise in undergraduate students; science outreach at multiple museums via exhibits and modules; sharing data, methods, and results via scientific dissemination, open access publications and social media; and curriculum development for K-12 students.<br/><br/>The Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO), increased global surface temperatures by 4 degrees Celsius, which is the same increase predicted for our modern climatic crisis by 2100.

Exactly how geological erosion rates are affected by short-lived but large-magnitude erosive events such as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, landslides, and wildfires remain poorly understood. This project focuses on the Woolsey Fire, which burned through ~100,000 acres of the Santa Monica Mountains, southern California, in November 2018. The Woolsey fire provides a unique opportunity to understand how a short-duration, large-magnitude fire disrupts and changes geological erosion rates owing to an existing dataset of pre-fire erosion rates determined in 2016. Through this project, three undergraduate research students will receive personalized training in Earth science research, analyze real-world data for senior theses, and learn how Earth?s surface changes in response to wildfires.<br/><br/>Geological erosion rates have been determined for thousands of rivers around the world by measuring the concentration of 10-beryllium (10Be) in quartz river sand. Measured 10Be concentrations are only produced in Earth?s near-surface and are thus sensitive to or diluted by short-lived deep-erosion events such as gully erosion, landslides, and debris flows, all of which are common following wildfires. The effect of post-fire erosion on measured 10Be concentrations is largely unknown because it is rare to have existing 10Be data from rivers that are subsequently affected by severe burning. This project benefits from a 10Be dataset collected from seven rivers draining the Santa Monica Mountains in 2016, two years prior to the 2018 Woolsey Fire. Four of these rivers were completely burned by the fire, providing the unique opportunity to (1) quantify how much measured 10Be concentrations in river sand have changed as a result of wildfire-caused erosion in burned catchments and (2) quantify the reproducibility of 10Be concentrations in unburned catchments. This project will have a clear and beneficial impact for the growing number of scientists who use 10Be data in their work because it serves to provide one of the first long-term, systematically-collected 10Be replicate sample sets in a steep, semiarid, fire-prone landscape. Because 10Be-derived erosion rates are used to contextualize modern human-induced sediment runoff, map seismic activity in tectonically-active regions, and assess landscape stability over geologically-meaningful timescales, this work will broadly benefit a wide range of professionals who rely on geomorphologists? ability to produce accurate and informative interpretations of sediment transport and landscape evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
